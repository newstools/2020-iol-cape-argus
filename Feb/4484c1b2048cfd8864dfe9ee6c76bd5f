Cape Town - There were weaves, heels, ball gowns and skimpy outfits in every colour as Capetonians descended on the Joseph Stone Auditorium in Athlone on Saturday for the 14th annual Mr and Miss Cape Town Pride Pageant. A total of 14 drag queens and 12 butch males put their best foot forward for the grand titles. The King and Queen get to parade at the Pride Festival next week, and winner Dyllan Areshaad, 23, from Stellenbosch says he can’t wait. “I’m incredibly proud of myself. The support I got from my family, friends and the public was good,” he says. Dylan sizzled in his swimwear, with diamante covering his crown jewels, and a pink suit for evening wear. Adrienne Galagatsi, 32, from Eerste River, was crowned Queen. Adrienne says: “It still feels unreal, after trying three times, you start to feel despondent, because this has always been a dream, and I finally made it.” She certainly made a statement in her bright orange swimsuit and stood out in the evening wear section. “The blue ombre and black sequin evening gown was a reflection of who I am and the different layers there is to who I am,” she says. Organiser, PJ Smith, says the event was a success: “It’s really encouraging to see that the Cape Town Pride pageant has grown into something that is taken seriously and this is evident in the fact that we have contestants who came from as far as Paarl and Hermanus to participate.” venecia.america@inl.co.za Daily Voice
