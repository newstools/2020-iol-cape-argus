Isaacs, whose friends described him as a true gentleman, was a fierce critic of apartheid and one of the most respected journalists of his time. He retired in 1999. He made his mark in journalism through his reporting on issues that affected the community. “He broke the colour barrier in terms of being the very first coloured reporter at the Argus. My dad was very passionate about his work and a very dedicated servant to his community. "Many of his stories were carried on the front pages of the newspaper up to four times a week. My dad leaves behind a great legacy as many other journalists of colour followed in his footsteps,” Isaacs’s son Zulfiq said on Sunday. He said his dad had the opportunity to study in London and was an active supporter of the Struggle. "He fought the system through the use of his pen.” Isaacs was ill for some time. He will be buried according to Muslim rites today. The funeral started at 10am at his home, 84 Chester Road, Walmer Estate, then at the Azzavia Mosque, then proceeds to the Mowbray cemetery. Isaacs leaves two sons and five grandchildren. Cape Argus  Do you have something on your mind; or want to comment on the big stories of the day? We would love to hear from you.
