The report, launched by Health MEC Nomafrench Mbombo, stated that the rate of homicides due to guns doubled from 2010 to 2016 and from 2010 to 2018 there has been a year-on-year increase in the annual number of homicides among men. The report aimed to highlight the province’s position with regard to health, the distribution of social determinants on health and selected interventions used in the province. Most of the increases in homicides were in the Cape Town Metro with Klipfontein, Mitchells Plain, Tygerberg, and Khayelitsha having the highest age-standardised homicide mortality rates in men in 2016. Lentegeur community policing forum (CPF) chairperson Byron de Villiers said changing the statistics would have to begin in the home. “In Lentegeur, it is mostly gang-related killings. There’s drug wars, turf wars and we lose our kids young.” Delft CPF chairperson Pastor Charles George said: “Townships were built to fail, they was built to manufacture your drug addicts and gangsters. If you look at the make-up and the environment of a township, there are no proper facilities for these young people like in other areas where they can go and have some form of entertainment. The only form of entertainment is your drug houses and your shebeens. “We can assist young people but we have to change the model. Young people today don’t play the way young people played 25 years ago.” shakirah.thebus@inl.co.za Cape Argus
