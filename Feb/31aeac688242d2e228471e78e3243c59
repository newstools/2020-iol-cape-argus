One refugee, who gave his name as Mbu from Cameroon said: “The judge gave the City seven days to take us to where the Department of Home Affairs will do their verification exercise. But the court ruling does not say precisely the exercise that has to take place.” Meanwhile, the spokesperson for the refugee group still inside the church, JP Balous, said: “We will not be appealing the judgment.” Executive Director for Safety and Security, Richard Bosman, provided an update on the refugee processing on Thursday morning, saying the City of Cape Town "would like to put on record that our first obligation is to give effect to the court order". "As stipulated by the court, the respondents have been informed of the order by the Sherriff of the Court and the verification process by the Department of Home Affairs is underway. "The City understands that there are a number of variables that could arise," Bosman said. "We will consider these, should there be a need, and make the best decision under the circumstances. "The City is committed to resolving the matter as speedily as possible, in line with the court order, and we ask that the public will allow the Department of Home Affairs and the City to give effect to the order." mwangi.githahu@inl.co.za Cape Argus
