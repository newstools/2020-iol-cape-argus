The secretary of the Judicial Service Commission (JSC), Sello Chiloane, said the committee had requested the parties to make written submissions on whether it should recommend that one or both complaints should be investigated by the Judicial Conduct Tribunal. “It is this point the committee will be dealing with today. The JSC Act postulates a process where each of the parties is granted an opportunity to make submissions to the committee, presided by the acting chairperson of the committee. “Following the hearing, the committee will consider both written and oral submissions, deliberate and make its decision. The committee may decide to recommend to the JSC that the complaints or one of them be investigated by a tribunal or refer one of the complaints or both complaints to the deputy chief justice,” said Chiloane. She said the Deputy Chief Justice may then designate a member of the committee to conduct an inquiry in terms of section 17 of the JSC Act to determine the merits of the complaint. Last month Judge Goliath lodged a complaint with the JSC accusing Hlophe of gross misconduct. Salie-Hlophe is a replying affidavit said the attack by Goliath was an attempt to oust to judge president in order to succeed him and garner herself the entitlement she believes she is rather more suitable for. According to Chiloane the media and the public would be notified of the decision as soon as that decision is made. vincent.cruywagen@inl.co.za Cape Argus
