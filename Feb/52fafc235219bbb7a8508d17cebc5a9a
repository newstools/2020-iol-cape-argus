The debate on the Sopa, and the premier’s reply to the debate, will commence on Friday at 8am at the same venue. Speaker Masizole Mnqasela said: “By hosting these events in Mitchells Plain this year, we are realising our desire and commitment to connect with the citizens of the province. Over the next four years we will continue to actively engage with citizens through a series of public engagement initiatives throughout the Western Cape. “The Sopa will outline the province’s plan for the next year, and the Western Cape provincial parliament, representing the people of the province, will monitor and oversee the government to ensure that the plan is put into action to benefit of the people of the province. “During the term of the sixth parliament of the Western Cape, we will continue to make every effort to take parliament closer to the people of the province.” Ahead of the function, which opposition parties in the province have slammed as being “costly and unnecessary”, legislators have been visiting the area in a bid to whip up interest in the event. On Wednesday morning, members of the legislature’s education committee were set to conduct an oversight visit to the Mitchells Plain Walking Bus Initiative at Springdale Primary School in Merrydale Avenue, led by DA Western Cape spokesperson on Education Lorraine Botha. mwangi.githahu@inl.co.za Cape Argus
