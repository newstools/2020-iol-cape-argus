Police still have to identify two other victims, a male and a female, who were also killed during Sunday’s incident. According to residents, a street committee patrolling the area had imposed a curfew on the streets from 9pm. Footage of the incident that went viral showed people screaming and trying in vain to douse the flames of the victims with sand. This attack comes after two alleged gangsters were also set alight two weeks ago in the same area. This brings the tally of mob justice-related deaths to five. Local pastor Lorraine Moko said: “There was a group that was formed to patrol in the area. It is unclear what their mandate is or who their leadership is. For me as a child protection officer and lead agent for child protection in that area, it is horrific. The horror is that children and women watched a person being burnt.” A community leader who was threatened and spoke on condition of anonymity said her fear was that mob justice incidents could escalate. Provincial police spokesperson Novela Potelwa said Public Order Police, supported by police from Muizenberg, neighbouring police stations and the City’s law enforcement officials have been keeping an eye on the area. “Thus far, the investigation has not yet determined the identities of the deceased as the bodies were badly burned,” Potelwa said.
