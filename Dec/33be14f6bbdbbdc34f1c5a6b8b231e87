Cape Town - Police Minister Bheki Cele was unexpectedly serenaded with the viral remix of “Umthandazo Wam” when he was conducting a visit to Rands over the weekend. Cele was on a two-day trip as part of a “Safer Festive Season” inspection tour in the Western Cape. On Thursday, he addressed a police parade just opposite the Bellville taxi rank before he conducted inspections, while on Friday evening he visited Long Street and Rands in Khayelitsha. Cele’s spokesperson, Lirandzu Themba, said: “He (Cele) found that there was some level of compliance when it came to establishments such as Rands and in Long Street. “He was quite pleased that the managers of these places put in place measures to ensure the safety of patrons, who were also keeping social distances and wearing masks.” Themba added: “The minister raised his concerns around people in some areas he visited who simply didn’t bother to wear their masks despite them having masks in their pockets. “No infringement notices were issued during his inspections.” However, it was during his visit to Rands that the police minister was treated to patrons at Rands serenading him with the viral remix of “Umthandazo Wam” by Mr Thela.
