CAPE TOWN: The mother of a Parkwood boy stabbed to death on the eve of his 17th birthday has expressed disbelief that only two of four suspects have been arrested. Mikyle Bruiners, his uncle and stepfather were stabbed by four boys. According to ward councillor William Akim, the two suspects were found in Hanover Park. The two teenage brothers who were arrested, appeared in the Wynberg Magistrate's Court on Wednesday. Police spokesperson FC van Wyk said they would be detained at a juvenile facility. Mikyle’s mother, Charlene Bruiners said two of four people detained would be "treated as witnesses". “I am not doing well. The two they left started the entire thing. The two were the first who grabbed Mikyle’s chain,” she said. The suspects had allegedly stolen a chain Mikyle received from his father as a birthday gift. “My husband is still injured, with a pipe in his lung (at Victoria Hospital). The uncle is here, very sick and stressed.” Bruiners described her son as kind. “He was like a child because he had Down syndrome. He was excited for his birthday. He bought all the small kids pellet guns with his money.” The teenager’s funeral is to take place on Saturday.
