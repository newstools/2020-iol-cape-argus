Cape Town - The Moslem Cemetery Board has decided to temporarily suspend all visits to the Mowbray Muslim Cemetery, to allow for clean-up operations to take place, following severe  damage to the property caused by an underground burst pipe. The burst pipe, located at the centre of the grounds, led to several days of flooding, causing extensive structural damage to the property and grounds. However, Mayco member for water and waste Xanthea Limberg said an investigation found no evidence of a pipe burst near the Mowbray cemetery and no service request was submitted to the City. But the cemetery board said at least 15 large trees were uprooted and the ground had sunk in many areas, causing damage to headstones and graves. The cemetery, however, will be open to allow for funerals, with strict Covid-19 protocols in place. The Kramat building (shrine of Muslim saints) was not left unaffected and was also flooded, causing damage to the flooring. Some trees remain lopsided and could pose a potential danger to those close by. The grounds continue to sink in certain areas, and staff had to fill them with clay and soil. “Although we acknowledge that visiting the grave and cemetery is important for a time of reflection, remembrance, to show honour for the deceased, and the relationship between family, we have to consider the safety, health and security of the community,” said a statement by the Moslem Cemetery Board. MCB Secretary Fazloodien Abrahams said the flooding first occurred early and throughout the month of September and October. The flooding also resulted in the sinking of many graves, collapsing of tombstones and supporting structures. “The ground directly above the body of some of the deceased collapsed 200mm to 500mm on average below the ground,” he said. Abrahams said clean-up operations would continue until January. Cape Argus
