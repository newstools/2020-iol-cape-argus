by Councillor Mark RH Kleinschmidt Cape Argus Columnist, Alex Tabisher’s Literally Yours, always displays much insight, depth and depicts his intelligence acquired through the “university of life”. An excellent pedagogue, his lifelong learning and experience is evident in "Address Gender Violence Before It Starts" (Cape Argus, 2 December). Tabisher succinctly goes to the root of GBV, and ultimately expounds that prevention is better than cure. Fix the problem before it manifests, and the Afrikaans idiomatic expression could apply, namely: "Buig 'n boompie as hy nog jonk is". (Bend a sapling while it is young). Currently, civil society is dealing with the symptoms and after-effects of male dominance inflicting psychological and physical harm and abuse on vulnerable women and children. Tabisher states correctly that, “our greatest gender abuse... we inflict upon Mother Earth”, (all forms of pollution, metaphorically), and his column attempts to, “promote peace” and “fight against any form of violence or abuse“. Tabisher’s highlighting of various issues in his column is commendable in its intention and, as a fellow educationist and language teacher, he demands my respect. Let Tabisher’s exhortations not fall on deaf ears, but instead, let the societal chains be broken by a very audible cry for help from those incarcerated through GBV. #EnoughIsEnough * Councillor Mark RH Kleinschmidt, Ward 60. ** The views expressed here are not necessarily those of Independent Media.
