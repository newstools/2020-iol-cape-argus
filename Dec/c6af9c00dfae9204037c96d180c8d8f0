Cape Town – The ANC in the Western Cape has asked Premier Alan Winde to urgently resolve issues the Western Cape Nguni traditional leadership raised about their dissatisfaction over suspension of the summer initiation season. The leadership claimed the cabinet was misled about consultation of initiation forums across the province by the Sports and Cultural Affairs MEC Anroux Marais, who announced the suspension on December 2. The ANC said the decision was taken without consulting the traditional leadership. “Traditional leaders are custodians of this rite and therefore any decision concerning the ritual can only be made by or in consultation with them,” the party said. President Cyril Ramaphosa on December 3 announced the initiation would continue, making it wrong for the province to unilaterally suspend the initiation. ANC cultural affairs and sports spokesperson Ayanda Bans said: “We are disappointed that Western Cape traditional leaders are treated with disdain by the provincial government. It is incorrect to not respond to concerns of traditional leaders for so long. The decision to lift the ban on initiation in the Western Cape rests with him (Winde), and he must resolve the issue urgently. The premier must apologise to the traditional leaders and elders.” Cultural affairs and sports department spokesperson Tania Colyn said the decision was consistent with the updated regulations. Colyn said decisions on what was permitted in terms of the regulations were taken by the National Coronavirus Command Council taking into account many variables. “In terms of section 73 (1) and 73 (2), initiation practices are still prohibited nationally except the Eastern Cape province, but excluding any area identified as a hot spot with effect from December 17,” she said.
