We suggest three: See the sunset Cape Town boasts some of the best sunsets, and there are plenty of places to watch them. Find a spot at a restaurant along the Atlantic Seaboard area or walk along the promenade at sunset. You can also visit Milnerton, Blaauberg or take a trip up Signal Hill – a famous sunset spot for locals. Cape Town celebrates sundowner culture, so you are bound to find many happy-hour specials.
