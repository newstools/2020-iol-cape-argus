Cape Town - The Grassy Park Community Police Forum (CPF) has urged residents to be cautious during the holidays. Chairperson Melvin Jonkers said illicit drug usage increased during the school holidays. “The CPF appeals to our communities to be alert and take special safety precautions. Criminals would ring the doorbell to check if there are people at home. If you do not know the person at your gate, do not engage them. If you feel unsafe, call the police." Bishop Lavis CPF chairperson Graham Lindhorst encouraged residents and motorists to report smash-and-grab incidents. “Every time people are told to not report the case and that they must get the perpetrator before laying a charge because there is no prospect of an arrest. “However we encourage people to report these cases because they assist with the statistics and if not reported the statistics get skewed and we are not able to get the resources we are supposed to have to fight this,” he said. Lindhorst said with the spike of incidents reported during this time on Jakes Gerwel Drive, neighbourhood watches (NHW) would be deployed. “In the past few years we have, between November and February deployed the NHW and it was successful because it reduced these incidents by 80 to 90 percent,” he said.
