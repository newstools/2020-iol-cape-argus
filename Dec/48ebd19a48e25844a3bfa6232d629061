Christmas is a time for giving and that’s exactly what Oprah Winfrey did for music mash-up genius, Jimir Reece Davis after he caught her attention. Oprah sent a surprise gift to Davis, who has been making waves in the music and film industry for his viral mash-ups of popular songs recently. Davis took to social media to rightfully brag about the Christmas gifts he received from the American media mogul and philanthropist. In the video, Davis read the card before opening the gifts. It read: “Dear Jimir. Thank you for bringing joy to the world your way. I hope this helps you continue. Holiday Blessings! Oprah”. A post shared by amorphous (@theofficialamorphous) On Instagram a caption accompanied the video which read: “thank you so much @oprah. 💞 thank you from the bottom of my heart, @oprah. 🥺 and thank you all so much for the continuous amount of support, love, and for accompanying me on this journey. 💞”. A post shared by amorphous (@theofficialamorphous) On December 8 Davis tweeted @Apple asking if he could get a new computer, since his MacBook is on its “last legs”. To his surprise, Oprah responded saying “Consider it done. New @apple MacBook on the way. My pleasure to help you bring us into 2021 dancing”. Consider it done. New @apple MacBook on the way.
