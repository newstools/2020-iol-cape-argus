by Councillor Mark RH Kleinschmidt Marc Lottering’s Lottering on Lockdown, directed by Anwar McKay and on at the Baxter Theatre, is by no means in "lockdown" as per the current level 1 Covid-19 regulations, with all protocols observed in the theatre. Lottering is at his funniest, and the introduction of popular Cape Town deejay Chad Chitter aka DJ Skouers is a welcome breath of fresh air, spinning a warm selection of hot hits culminating with the ever popular SA hit, Jerusalema. Lottering spices up his lockdown show, depicting ordinary persons’ lockdown idiosyncrasies with laugh-a-minute anecdotes by his alter egos, Aunty Merle and Colleen the cashier. Lottering on Lockdown is a healthy tonic against the backdrop of the pandemic of Covid-19, which has left us overwhelmed and petrified with fear. Lottering’s latest offering is a definite must-see and positive inclusion on your festive season entertainment calendar. Well done and thank you, Marc! * Councillor Mark RH Kleinschmidt, Ward 60. ** The views expressed here are not necessarily those of Independent Media.
