Cape Town - The City of Cape Town has said that sections of Strandfontein beach will be temporarily closed for safety reasons while contractors undertake the decommissioning of the temporary Strandfontein desalination plant. The beach will be temporarily closed from Monday, December 14, to Tuesday, December 15; while contractors work on the seaward side to move part of the intake and brine pipelines. “These sections of the pipelines will be temporarily stored next to the existing intake infrastructure, in the ocean, which is already indicated with a marker buoys at a depth of approximately seven metres until it can be removed after the festive season. “Residents are reminded that the area will be treated as a construction site and all applicable safety practices and procedures will apply. Also, the City will ensure that the area is rehabilitated and restored to the same condition as before,” the City said. “In the meantime, we kindly request that beachgoers avoid the construction site and instead make use of the rest of the facilities at Strandfontein.” Cape Argus Do you have something on your mind; or want to comment on the big stories of the day?
