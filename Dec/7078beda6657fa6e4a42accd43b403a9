Cape Town – Covid-19 has again affected the case against Zane Killian, an accused co-conspirator in the murder of Anti-Gang Unit detective Charl Kinnear. The matter was previously postponed after the court heard the leading prosecutor in the matter was self isolating after he was in contact with a Covid-19 positive colleague. In September, Killian, 39, was charged with the murder of Kinnear, conspiracy to commit murder, illegal interference in communication and fraud. According to the State, he “pinged” Kinnear’s cellphones to establish the police officer’s location between March and September 18, the day he was shot dead. He appeared in absentia in the Bellville Magistrate's Court on Tuesday and was expected apply for bail. National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) spokesperson Eric Ntabazalila, said that the matter was postponed as “the accused is in isolation at Goodwood Prison”. “He was in contact with a cellmate who displayed Covid-19 symptoms. The parties were advised of this development on Monday afternoon and protocols of Goodwood Prison where the accused is held are that all the accused in that group are isolated and are not allowed to attend court. “Tests have been conducted on the cellmate and results are expected on Thursday or Friday. As a result of this development, the case has been postponed to December 15 2020,” Ntabazalila said. “If the results come back positive, the matter will not sit on December 15, as the accused will be in quarantine for 10 days as is required for any person who has been in contact with a person with Covid-19. It will be postponed to January 2021.” Ntabazalila said that should the results come back negative, the bail application will start at the Bellville Regional Court, but added the matter won’t be heard in full. “The court has warned throughout that there are other matters on the roll on that day and the bail application might be partly heard and rolled over to January 2021.” Cape Argus
