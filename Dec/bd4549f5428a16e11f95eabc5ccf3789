Cape Town - The Anglican Bishop of George has voiced his concern about the lack of action to stop the spread of the coronavirus on the Garden Route. Bishop Brian Marajh urged people in the region to avoid unnecessary travel. South Africa has officially entered a second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, according to Health Minister Zweli Mkhize, who made the announcement last night. In a span of 24 hours the country recorded 6 079 new cases of Covid-19. Infections are on the rise in six provinces, with the main drivers being the Eastern Cape, Western Cape, KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng. In a statement, he said: “A hard lockdown will cause further suffering, but other steps short of that could help. Yet nothing has been done about curbing the movement of people through an extended curfew. “Nothing has been done to manage the sale of alcohol, and nothing to limit the number of people at mass gatherings, including religious gatherings.” Marajh said the public had been left to manage themselves in the absence of action by both national and provincial governments. Since the November by-elections in George and Knysna, there had been a significant increase in the movement of people in the area. He said: “Citizens must please behave responsibly. We call on you and commit ourselves to manage our travelling carefully. If we don’t have to travel, let us stay at home. “If we have to cancel holiday arrangements, it will be worth it to protect our loved ones, our fellow citizens and ourselves.” Cape Argus
