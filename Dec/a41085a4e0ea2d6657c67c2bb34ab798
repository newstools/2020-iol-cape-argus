Cape Town – The mother of a slain 17-year-old boy with Down syndrome received much-needed support from the Wyatt’s Down Syndrome Foundation. Mikyle Bruiners was stabbed in the chest and died at a children’s playground on Saturday in Willow Walk, Parkwood. Mikyle died in the arms of his grandmother Ann Bruiners, 65, with whom he stayed in Beulah Court. A few hours before the stabbing, Mikyle was robbed of a chain, given to him by his father, by four teenagers. The father of one of the teens returned the chain, but the boys then returned to threaten Mikyle. His uncle and stepfather were also stabbed. The family received groceries and a cash donation as the global community commemorated International Day of Persons with Disabilities yesterday. The foundation’s PR officer, Patsy Anthony said: “While the Wyatt’s Foundation observes the month of disability, we also highlight 16 Days of Activism for No Violence against Women and Children which runs concurrently with Disability Month.” Police spokesperson FC van Wyk confirmed two suspects, aged 14 and 16, were arrested on Tuesday and made a brief court appearance in the Wynberg Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday on a case of murder and two attempted murder cases. They will appear again in two weeks and are currently being held at a juvenile facility. According to ward councillor William Akim, the suspects were apprehended by the Grassy Park police in Hanover Park. Mikyle’s mother Charlene Bruiners said: “I’m very happy and glad (about the donation). I am thankful for them for cheering me up because I didn’t expect it.” A memorial service was held at the playground on Thursday. Cape Argus
