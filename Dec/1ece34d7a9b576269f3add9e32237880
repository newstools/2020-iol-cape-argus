Cape Town – Head of the Department of Health in the Western Cape, Dr Keith Cloete, has provided an update on the status on the Cuban doctors who were deployed to the province earlier in the year. More than 200 Cuban experts arrived in South Africa in April, consisting of family physicians, epidemiologists, biostatisticians, healthcare technology engineers, biotechnology experts and other specialists. Health MEC Nomafrench Mbombo at the time said the Cubans would be deployed to various provincial health facilities to support efforts in the Covid-19 fight. Earlier in week, during the digital conference, Cloete provided an update on where the Cuban doctors were located since the decommission of the CTICC filed hospital. “We have 18 Cuban medics who are clinically orientated, so they are clinical specialists. We have some additional Cubans who are working with biostatistics and epidemiology – they work with our central team around the data. “The 18 that are clinical doctors – 11 in the metro, and seven in rural areas. Three are at Brackengate, another eight are other places in the metro,” Cloete said. “The seven in the rural areas are mainly in the Garden Route, but they are in more than one place in the rural areas. “They are distributed across our entire platform, based on the experience they had during the first wave, where they were mainly at the CTICC. “We’ve actually distributed them strategically in places based on the skills they picked up and how they can contribute to the system.” Cape Argus
