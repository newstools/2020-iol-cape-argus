Cape Town - The slight decline in Cape Town and the province’s dam levels is as a result of rising temperatures and the end of the rainy season, according to the latest hydrological report from the Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS). The total capacity of dams supplying the Cape Town Metro decreased by 1.2%  between December 7 and 13 - from 96.8% the previous week to 95.6%. Mayco member for water and waste Xanthea Limberg said, “Daily water consumption for the same period increased by 26 million litres a day to 749 million litres a day. At the same time last year, dam levels were at 78.9%.” Local Government Environmental Affairs and Development Planning MEC Anton Bredell said: “The latest average level for dams in the Western Cape is 75.9%. A year ago the level stood at 61.8%.” Urging members of the public, including visitors to the province, to continue to use water responsibly, Bredell said: “We urge consumers to report suspected water leaks to their nearest municipal offices for action as soon as possible. Every drop matters.” Meanwhile, DWS spokesperson Sputnik Ratau has urged citizens of the Western Cape to intensify hand washing to curb the spread of Covid-19. Ratau said: “The simple practice of washing hands with soap and water is one of the more effective ways to prevent the spread of Covid-19. “To further prevent the spread of Covid-19 the DWS has distributed and installed water tanks in densely populated informal settlements to enable communities to wash hands during and beyond the pandemic,” said Ratau.
