Cape Town – Mayor Dan Plato has yet to make a decision regarding the Woodstock Exchange development, which housing activists are eyeing for affordable housing. In March, the City’s Municipal Planning Tribunal approved the application by Signatura Property Development to add 82 units to the Woodstock Exchange, but housing activist and law centre group, Ndifuna Ukwazi, and residents appealed the decision. The City’s spokesperson, Luthando Tyhalibongo, said: “The City is still awaiting the decision of the mayor on this matter. The City’s executive mayor is the final appeal authority in terms of the City’s Municipal Planning by-law insofar as it relates to planning decisions.” The City’s Planning Appeals Advisory Panel held a meeting last week to discuss the proposal. The development received objections for excluding inclusionary housing and contributing to gentrification in the Woodstock and Salt River areas. Woodstock Residents’ Association member Andrea Couvert said: “In the specific case of Woodstock, it includes the social composition, the mix of different groups and communities, and the historic presence of working families with a low income. “A development focused on small apartments for professionals with a high income, completely unsuitable for families, can be a real danger for social diversification that represents a heritage asset for Woodstock.” An attorney at Ndifuna Ukwazi, Jonty Cogger, said: “The proposed development will increase residential opportunities for people who can afford to live in the area. “This is not the only socio-economic consideration. The Spatial Planning and Land Use Management Act also gives effect to the right to access adequate housing in section 26 of the Constitution.” Cape Argus
