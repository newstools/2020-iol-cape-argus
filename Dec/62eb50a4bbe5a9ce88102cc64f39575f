Cape Town – Langa backyard dwellers are angry with the City over the planned relocation of Joe Slovo fire victims to a site next to Mokone Primary School. They have for more than a week staged a sit-in at the site to stop the relocation. Initially an initiation site was considered for the relocation, but heritage organisations in the area successfully fought this. Backyard dwellers spokesperson Simphiwe Vuso said the City failed to consult the community and the ward councillor about the relocations. “The place was reserved for the extension of the cemetery by the late councillor Nomtha Dilima, but all of the sudden the people of Joe Slovo are to be moved to the space. That is what angers the community. Every single year there is some sort of fire that is created deliberately so that these people get first preference when there is new housing development. That is their modus operandi and people are now sick of their tactics and what the City is doing. What they are doing is creating some of a chaos and animosity between us and the residents,” he said. Mayoral member for human settlements Malusi Booi said preparations relocating the victims were at an advanced stage. “We are currently engaging the receiving community as the people are moving from one ward to another. We have started preparations this week but the receiving community had concerns and we are now dealing with them. One of the things we have to make them understand is that the arrangement is temporary and not a permanent solution for the victims,” he said. Vuso said backyard dwellers were now sleeping outside at the site to ensure nobody from Joe Slovo occupied it. “Up until we get a proper response from the City on the letter we have written to the mayor, we will continue sleeping here. The City is inciting black on black violence because if there is no space, and if they really care about these people, they can move them to other areas where there is enough space,” he said.
