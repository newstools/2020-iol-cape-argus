The following letter by Michael Bagraim refers to, “Top award for Suzanne Ackerman-Berman for her role in food relief initiative”: I attended the virtual award ceremony last Sunday night when Suzanne Ackerman-Berman won the Europe Car Women in Leadership Award. Not only was it a prestigious award with many accolades forthcoming, but Suzanne Ackerman-Berman specifically said that she accepted the award on behalf of everyone who worked together with her within the Pick n Pay and Boxer stores group. The humble approach to this shows the actual worth of the woman. It should also be known that Suzanne has been and is involved in many other feeding schemes across the country. The Ackerman family have been an enormous source of inspiration to literally hundreds of others. * Michael Bagraim, Cape Town. ** The views expressed here are not necessarily those of Independent Media.
