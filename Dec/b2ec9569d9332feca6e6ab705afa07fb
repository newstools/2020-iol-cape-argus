Earlier this week it was announced that the country’s Covax participation was secured after a down payment of $19.2 million (about R283m) was made to secure South Africa’s entry into the Covax facility. South Africa has recorded the most coronavirus infections on the African continent, with more than 954 000 confirmed cases and more than 25 000 deaths to date. Mkhize warned citizens that current restrictions may need to be reviewed as the country recorded more than 14 000 new Covid-19 cases in the past 24 hours. IOL
