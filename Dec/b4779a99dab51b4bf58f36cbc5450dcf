by Christopher Smith The passing of Diego Maradona was a sad occasion for many, but what was sadder still was the way he was lauded. In my humble opinion, he was not the greatest player of all time, but what he definitely was, was an example of our hypocrisy. Diego was a drug and alcohol abuser and most disgustingly, he was a cheat who excused his handball at the World Cup against England as “the hand of God”. Amazingly, another handball cheat was a certain Thierry Henry of France, also hailed as a “great”. We look down upon and despise the man on the street for being a drunk, a “druggie” and a “skelm”, yet we applaud and praise those mentioned as great. I was astounded to hear on the radio that Hansie Cronjé was also still being acclaimed and missed as one of those. Unfortunately, there are many more like them, yet we expect our children to aspire to “greatness”.  Not with those examples. What sad times we live in. * Christopher Smith, Diep River. ** The views expressed here are not necessarily those of Independent Media.
