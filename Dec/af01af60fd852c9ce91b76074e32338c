Cape Town - The City of Cape Town has cancelled several of its flagship events after a resurgence in Covid-19 cases emerged. The Festive Lights Switch-On open-air concert was cancelled due to the National State of Disaster regulations prohibiting gatherings with more than 500 people. The open-air concert usually attracts a crowd of around 100 000 people on the Grand Parade, along Darling and Adderley streets. Mayco member for safety and security JP Smith said: “The City sets aside around R5 million for logistical requirements such as fencing, toilets, a stage, sound, big screens to cover the extended footprint on the Grand Parade into Darling and Adderley streets. “Due to the cancellation of the traditional event, the funds have been allocated to smaller events spread over the year including those that form part of the CBD revitalisation programme.” All City-run summer markets scheduled to take place during the festive period have also been postponed. The Cape Town Summer Market, which is most popular, usually attracts an estimated 5 000 people per night during the five hours of operation. Mayco member for urban development Grant Twigg said: “The City has taken into consideration the socio-economic impact that the postponement of the markets will have on its residents. "However, we have had to take into consideration the possible impact on the health of residents as well as the health-care system in general. “A single super-spreader event will have a much bigger impact on the economy of the City of Cape Town and we have had to make this tough call to postpone the summer markets and make responsible decisions to protect our people from this deadly pandemic,” said Twigg.
