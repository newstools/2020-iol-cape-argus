Cape Town - Western Cape Premier Alan Winde on Thursday explained how all the departments will be implementing the newly announced three-pronged approach to curbing the Covid-19 resurgence. Speaking during his regular digital news conference on Thursday, Winde announced the provincial government’s three-pronged-approach to roll-back the Covid-19 resurgence. The approach includes continuing the Western Cape’s current health response to ensure that every person gets care when they need it, working with individuals, communities and businesses to change their behaviour to adopt protective measures, and lastly, increasing the enforcement of existing level 1 regulations. The premier explained how the various departments will work together to prevent new infections of Covid-19: Winde said: “All of these interventions will be done in line with our zero-tolerance approach to corruption, and our provincial treasury will continue to publish monthly Procurement Disclosure Reports so every cent can be accounted for. “The Western Cape believes in localised, targeted approaches to outbreaks and that adopting province or country wide measures for a problem in one geographic would have many negative consequences for South Africa’s recovery. “The power is in your hands and on your face. Take action now, wear your mask, avoid the 3Cs and help save lives and livelihood,” he said. Cape Argus
