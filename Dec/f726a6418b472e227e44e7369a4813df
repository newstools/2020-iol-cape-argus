Cape Town - With just a few days to go to Christmas, residents on the Cape Flats and in other communities are calling for a festive ceasefire. This as gang violence seems to be taking an uglier turn, with numerous reports of shooting incidents and murders. Local community activists and leaders are calling on policing bodies to intensify their anti-gang and crime initiatives in local communities over the festive season weekends, in an effort to curb the rise in criminal incidents which are holding residents hostage in several communities across the city. There have been more reports of gun violence and gang murders taking place in the days leading into the Christmas weekend. Kraaifontein Community Development Forum secretary Louis Botha said while December was the highpoint of the busy holiday season, it was also known to be a destructive period. “December holidays are the time when many industries shut down for holidays, and schools also close down. We tend to see an increase in road accidents, crime, drug and alcohol abuse, domestic violence, child neglect, drownings, injuries and deaths around this time. “This year, however, we also have the burden of dealing with the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, meaning that the work to be done in our communities is much more paramount. We need the SAPS and other law enforcement agencies not only to increase their visibility in all crime hot spots but also to actively protect our children during the festive period.” Botha’s sentiments were echoed by Bishop Lavis CPF chairperson Graham Lindhorst who said that visible policing was the answer in the community’s battle with gang violence. Lindhorst said: “For us, visible policing is the answer. The more that police are visibly patrolling in our communities, the less confidence gangsters will have, and that will give residents an opportunity to enjoy their festive holidays.” Cape Argus
