Cape Town - Preliminary investigations have shown that a fire that ripped through Masiphumelele township last Thursday was largely the work of land invaders, mayor Dan Plato said on Tuesday. Plato, who visited the area to check on the progress made in clearing the site, said  reeds were lit to clear land, leading to the destruction of 1 300 dwellings and displacing over 5 000 people on Thursday. “Because of this criminality, thousands will now spend their Christmas having to rebuild their structures,” he said. “I strongly urge anyone with information to come forward to bring those responsible to book as we must send a strong message to discourage this criminal behaviour from affecting the lives and well-being of our residents.” Last week, Plato signed a local disaster declaration to access relief funding from the national government in terms of the Disaster Management Act. He said the R18 million relief funding would cover fire kits, re-establishing electricity connections and water infrastructure. “As we await relief funding to become available from the national government, City of Cape Town officials remain hard at work assisting residents,” said Plato. “Funding will be channelled ... through the Western Cape government as per legislated requirements. The city is doing its best to expedite the process as far as its powers allow.” The city of Cape Town and other organisations last week put out an appeal for donations from the public for essential items such as blankets, baby food, nappies, baby milk and non-perishable food to the Living Hope organisation in Masiphumelele.
