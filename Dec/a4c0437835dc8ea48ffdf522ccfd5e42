Cape Town – Golden Arrow Bus Services has finally ended the long-time fight over whether to open the bus windows or leave it closed while passengers commute on the bus. Golden Arrow Bus Services (Gabs) took to Facebook on Tuesday and gave a statement calling on commuters to leave the windows open when taking bus rides. “The fight over whether to open or close windows probably dates back to the first horse-drawn carriage but it's time to end the argument once and for all. “There really is no valid reason for not opening them. “Worried about your hair – wear a scarf. “Cold – bring a jersey,” Gabs said. “Any slight discomfort is far outweighed by the benefits of a well-ventilated bus. “We cannot be on every bus checking every window so please help us to do the right thing and keep them open.” The statement comes amid the second wave of Covid-19 infections across the country. The Western Cape government and Premier Alan Winde have called on residents to avoid overcrowding, and to ensure there is good ventilation in enclosed areas. “We must all take the appropriate safety measures to reduce the risk of contracting Covid-19: wear your mask, wash your hands and practice social distancing,” Winde said. “This festive season, avoid large crowds, gatherings and places where there is close contact or overcrowding. “Our task now is to do everything possible to prevent ourselves and our loved ones from being infected by the virus, or from spreading the virus.” Cape Argus
