Cape Town - ANC MP Faiez Jacobs’s comments have landed him in hot water with City council Speaker Dirk Smit who threatened to report Jacobs to the police for allegedly calling for Mayco member of Safety and Security JP Smith to be “dealt with”. Jacobs’ comments were circulating via social media in a WhatsApp group. Jacobs posted on a Bonteheuwel Community WhatsApp Group and allegedly stated that “JP must be dealt with!” and that a “Showdown (sic) is coming!” Smit said he wanted Jacobs to clarify what he meant, “Otherwise I will be referring the matter to the Western Cape Police Commissioner for investigation, as is the standard procedure when any threats are made against any of our councillors. “I look forward to receiving an explanation from Jacobs, since, as the custodian of council, I view the safety of all councillors as paramount and any threats or threatening remarks being made in relation to any of our councillors are unacceptable and will not be tolerated. “It is not only wholly inappropriate for a member of national parliament to make such comments on a social media platform, but even more so when such comments are being made to attack and seemingly threaten a City councillor who is simply exercising his statutory duties. “He (Jacobs) needs to be careful of what he puts on social media; he is a public representative.” Jacobs said: “I have taken an oath to serve our people and protect our Constitution. Serving our people is guided by ethical behaviour. “When the DA seeks to distort my words and give a violent meaning to what I meant when I said JP Smith must be dealt with, it is trying to create a storm because I’m exposing them and people are beginning to see them for what they are. “He must be dealt with because he is arrogant and racist. They must be dealt with because they are causing suffering and division. Let’s expose the hypocrisy. There is a litany of injustices,” said Jacobs. Cape Argus
