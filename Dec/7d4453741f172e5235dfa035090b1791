Cape Town - Filling vacancies in the Western Cape Treasury has come under the spotlight during discussions of the department’s annual report to the standing committee on finance, economic opportunities and tourism. ANC spokesperson on finance, Nomi Nkondlo, and committee chairperson Deidre Baartman quizzed Finance and Economic opportunities MEC David Maynier on the department’s talent pool. The questions came after head of department David Savage said in his presentation to the committee: “Filling vacancies is always challenging in the department. We require quite specific technical skills in financial matters.” He acknowledged critical vacancies had been left unfilled. Nkondlo asked: “Did the current deputy director-general for asset management, Julinda Gantana, or any other employees of the provincial treasury apply for the HOD post? And if they did, what were the issues that prevented them being promoted to the post?” Baartman said: “In the annual report, you indicated the department’s turnover rate. I want to know about the turnover rate, especially with regards to the turnover rate for women. “What are you doing to develop a succession plan? If you increase the pool of talent in an organisation, you’ll have more people that you are able to pick from.” Maynier responded: “There were internal candidates that applied for the HOD position, but there was a very thorough and competitive selection process and the decision of the panel was unanimous.” “But that should not be taken to mean that we are not committed to - as it were - growing our own timber and growing our talent pool. But ultimately, building a strong, independent treasury is certainly going to, over time, take a combination of both internal and external candidates,” said Maynier. Cape Argus
