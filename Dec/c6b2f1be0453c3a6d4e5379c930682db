by Colin Bosman Suggestions in some quarters that Long Street is a hot spot and super spreader of Covid 19 resulting in constant raids by SAPS officers are disingenuous and simply not accurate. The reason that SAPS spends Friday nights harassing clubs and bars in Long Street is because Long Street is an easy target. No fightback, no physical attacks on the police, no verbal attacks on them, no intimidation. Nice and easy, nice and safe. Taverns and clubs and street parties in the townships is a different matter entirely where the police are simply not safe. Many SAPS officers also live in those areas making it difficult to raid and enforce the law in their own backyards, so logically they don’t go there. Furthermore, according to the official Covid-19 trackers, the resurgence of Covid-19 is filtering down from the Eastern Cape, down the Garden Route and eventually into the city. The correct protocol logically would be to lock down the area where the virus is picking up again, which is the Eastern Cape. Allowing the free flow of traffic into Cape Town from the Eastern Cape where Covid-19 is spiking guarantees a flare up in the city. It’s not rocket science. As for Long Street, that’s simply the final destination of the a Covid-19 virus that’s travelled down from outside of the city, it’s not a hot spot right now and most certainly doesn’t deserve all the attention from SAPS that it’s getting. * Colin Bosman, Newlands. ** The views expressed here are not necessarily those of Independent Newspapers.
