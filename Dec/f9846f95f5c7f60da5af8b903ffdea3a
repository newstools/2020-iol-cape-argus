by Brandon de Kock We, the SGB of Heathfield High School, feel compelled to respond to the inaccuracies presented by WCED spin-doctor Bronagh Hammond as published in the Cape Argus, November 26 (WCED has no record of meeting requested by Heathfield High School SGB). In an article to the Southern Mail Community on October 7, Hammond categorically stated that the HOD Brian Schreuder did not issue instructions to the principal of Heathfield High to issue letters to the matric parents for all learners to return to school with immediate effect. She stated that this instruction was never issued. We are in possession of a copy of the original letter to the community newspaper where she states that Mr Schreuder never issued an instruction to that effect. Now in the Cape Argus she states that such an instruction was issued. Hammond has a history of twisting the facts to suit her employer’s narrow political agenda. We call on her moral conscience to not mislead the honest people of the Western Cape. As a public servant, she is duty-bound to serve the interests of the people of the Western Cape and not her political bosses. * Brandon de Kock, Heathfield High SGB treasurer. ** The views expressed here are not necessarily those of Independent Media.
