Cape Town - Several local businesses, organisations and concerned residents have responded to the dire need for those affected by the Masiphumelele fire that destroyed about 1 000 shacks and left nearly 6 000 people destitute. Local businesses among a number of organisations in the community have been working hard to source and collect essential donations, funds and food for the affected families. On Friday afternoon in Noordhoek, artist Ard Mathews, during his show at Cafe Roux managed to raise R38 000 in under a few minutes in support of Cafe Roux’s Masiphumelele disaster relief efforts. Yesterday the Cafe hosted another outdoor musical fund-raiser in an effort to continue its response to the Masiphumelele disaster. Cafe Roux owner Lindi Green said: “We come from such an amazing community. The way everyone in this place has come together to support and help those in need is simply amazing. After Ard Mathew’s performance on Friday we decided to do another fund-raising event and this time all the businesses in the complex chipped in to support.” Also in response to the Masiphumelele disaster the Noordhoek and Fish Hoek CAN and a number of other organisations have been actively facilitating donations and fund-raising. Noordhoek and Fish Hoek CAN’s Nicola van Schaik said the organisation’s primary role in the fire response was to actively share the call for assistance within the networks they are affiliated with. “Our main goal was to assist in generating donations and facilitating aid efforts for the victims of the fire. I was really impressed and pleased with the way Cape Town residents from all walks of life came together to support Masiphumelele residents. “From soup kitchens based in the community to those living on the Cape Flats, everyone chipped in along with those who had resources. That for me has been amazing to witness,” said Van Schaik. Cape Argus
