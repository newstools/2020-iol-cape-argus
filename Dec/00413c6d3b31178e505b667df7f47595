Cape Town - The recent arrests and confiscation of illegal drugs, firearms and ammunition in Cape Town have spurred citizens into calling for an end to ongoing violence and crime. With the festive season around the corner, police and law enforcement anti-crime initiatives are gaining momentum – and more support from residents to rid their streets of crime. Bonteheuwel councillor Angus Mackenzie said residents were setting up a safety plan in partnership with neighbourhood watches and law enforcement officers. “Our shooting/gang murder rate has declined sharply year on year due to the partnership between the community, my office and law enforcement, with a renewed focus on visible policing. Later this week, we plan to employ 20 community safety ambassadors to help keep Bonteheuwel safe.” At the weekend, police made arrests and confiscated illegal guns and ammunition in anti-crime prevention initiatives. In Manenberg, on Friday, police apprehended four men aged between 22 and 32, found in possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition in College Road, Manenberg. Police spokesperson FC Van Wyk said that the men who are known to Gugulethu are due to appear in the Athlone Magistrates Court. Manenberg Community Activist Bronwyn February said that the community was pleased by the arrests and anti-crime initiatives which would go a long way in ensuring that residents from the community have a peaceful and non-violent Christmas. In Delft, on Friday, they arrested a 15-year-old boy for the possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition. In Kraaifontein, on Sunday, acting on a tip-off, police arrested two men with an Eskom transformer worth R50 000. Cape Argus
