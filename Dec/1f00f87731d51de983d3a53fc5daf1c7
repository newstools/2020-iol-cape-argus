Cape Town - The City of Cape Town’s safety and security staff have had a busy week conducting compliance visits to ensure residents and establishments are adhering to Covid-19 safety regulations. According to Mayco member for safety and security JP Smith, in the past week City staff have conducted 220 compliance visits at swimming pools, more than 1 300 visits to beaches, 365 visits to retailers, shopping malls and corner shops, 45 visits to entertainment/licensed establishments and 68 visits to public transport interchanges. This is part of the the City of Cape Town’s plan to ensure compliance and contain the further spread of Covid-19 infections as a second wave hits the country. A nightclub in Long Street was found to be operating at 11pm and exceeding occupancy rates as stipulated in the disaster management regulations. Other complaints responded to included restaurants, churches and liquor stores alleged to be operating in contravention of the regulations. “We have been very clear in our message to the public, but also businesses, about the need for self-regulation. To the many people who have taken the message to heart and who have given up on many traditions to comply with Covid-19 regulations, we say thank you,” Smith said. “Unfortunately there will always be those who behave like they are a law unto themselves or believe that the rules do not apply to them. One would think that the health crisis we are battling with would be reason enough to comply, but experience shows this not to be the case. “Our staff will continue to enforce the regulations to the best of their ability, but we appeal for common sense and co-operation from our city,” added Smith.
