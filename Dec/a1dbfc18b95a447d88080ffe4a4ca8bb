Cape Town - In an effort to reclaim the streets from criminals, four provincial police divisions joined youngsters in Mfuleni’s Parliament Street for games and indigenous activities. The event was part of a three-day programme under the 16 Days of No Violence Against Women and Children campaign. It will be followed by a 6km walk against gender-based violence (GBV) today from Nyanga, where Amahle Quku was killed at Gugulethu, followed by a youth dialogue at Kleinvlei Church in Eerste River on Wednesday. Youth Crime Prevention co-ordinator Muriel Maluleka said: “Mfuleni is one of the top eight stations for GBV, and Parliament Street is a hot spot in the area. We wanted to claim back our street by playing indigenous games to experience the fun of our townships. Because of today, children and women don’t feel safe any more to be on the streets. “We used to grow up playing such games. We are putting the community structures into task by continuing with these activities.” Men For Change provincial chairperson Lindikhaya Mkhontwana said the campaign was to bring together three groups: youth, women and men. “Men must have the ear and the consciousness to receive the message. It’s of no use to speak to only women as it does not resolve the problem. “To the youth, we wanted them to understand that we are heeding the call from the president who has declared GBV as a pandemic, and that they must emulate where we have started off during their time,” he said. Women Network chairperson Joyce Sakati said: “Through this we want to showcase to the community that we are here to assist them.” Cape Argus
