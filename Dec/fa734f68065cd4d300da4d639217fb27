by  IJ Saks The Zondo Commission must not be threatened by anyone in South Africa, especially the Umkhonto we Sizwe Military Veterans Association (MKMVA) whose spokesperson is Charl Niehaus, a Zuma loyalist. Why he gets so much publicity on eNCA is beyond me, as he is President Cyril Ramaphosa’s enemy. Zondo will carry out his duties and Zuma will go to jail if he is arrested, because he walked out of the commission without permission. That is criminal. If these people are not brought to book, then the Zondo Commission has failed in its duty and all the taxpayers’ money funding it would have been in vain. All the organisations trying to derail the commission must be stopped and put in their place. The law must take its course. * IJ Saks, Table View. ** The views expressed here are not necessarily those of Independent Media.
