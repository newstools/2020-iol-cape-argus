Cape Town - Trustee of Feed the Nation Foundation Suzanne Ackerman-Berman has won the Europcar Women in Leadership Award at the SA Jewish Report Achievers Awards for the leading role she has played in feeding the nation during the pandemic. Ackerman-Berman, who is also transformation director at Pick n Pay, was selected from 24 other leading women nominees doing extraordinary impactful work across South Africa, in the fields of science and medicine, music, art and community development. The accolade seeks to honour the leadership, impact, achievements, success and overall contribution of distinctive women in business or in the broader South African community. Accepting her award during a virtual ceremony on Sunday evening, Ackerman-Berman said: “This year has been a terribly difficult time for each and every one of us, but it’s often during the worst of times, when we’re facing hardship, troubles and challenges, that the best in people come out. “Over the past eight months, in what started out as the Feed the Nation campaign, over 900 Pick n Pay stores and Boxer Superstores sourced, packed and distributed food hampers to those in need across the country.” Head of Jewish Community Services in Cape Town, Hazel Levine, said: “She has the most incredible determination; she will put herself on the line for just about anything.” Chairperson of Afrika Tikkun and the Smile Foundation, Marc Lubner, said: “What many don’t know is that Suzanne contracted the virus herself, but no one would have ever known as she continued to operate in isolation. She never prioritised herself; everyone else came first.” Cape Argus
