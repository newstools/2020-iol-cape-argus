Cape Town – A Golden Arrow bus in Mfuleni and two delivery trucks in Eerste River Way were set alight over the weekend. Golden Arrow spokesperson Bronwen Dyke-Beyer said the incident followed two failed petrol-bombings on Thursday night and two on Friday morning, with a minor injury reported. She said at this stage the motive was not clear as there was no protest action or activity in the vicinity. “We are concerned about this. It is essential that people are able to travel safely, our passengers and our staff, and we cannot let this continue. We condemn these acts of violence in the strongest possible terms and would like to remind the public that we are offering a R200 000 reward for information that leads to the arrests and convictions of the arsonists. We are working closely with the SAPS and law enforcement,” she said. Transport portfolio chairperson Angus McKenzie said the torching remained a major problem. “The ongoing vandalism and torching of these buses, we must accept is not service delivery failures but criminality bordering on absolute terrorism. “These individuals that are consistently torching these buses are placing the lives of thousands of vulnerable people at huge inconvenience, not being able to go to work and be able to do what they need to do,” he said. McKenzie said he was satisfied with the reward that Golden Arrow had put out for information on this, and said he was hoping that someone would come forward. “However, it is critical that the SAPS start making the necessary arrests and investigate these arsons that are taking place because it’s further going to hamper the economy and people getting jobs if this continues at this rate,” he said.
