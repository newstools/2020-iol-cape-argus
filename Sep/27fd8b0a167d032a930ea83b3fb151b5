Cape Town - A former sex worker has found peace by telling her story of the sexual violence she endured and hopes to encourage other women to seek the same relief. Louise Pietersen, 31, from Wellington, has gained emotional relief after years of sexual abuse while working as a sex worker in Long Street. She is a trauma and writing counsellor for 1000 Women Trust and Hope Prison Ministry and her own Arise Women Circle. “I can boldly tell my story now because I know how much healing power there is in putting words to pain. "I love working with and helping other women who know a lot about where I come from. Every time I tell my story, I heal a little more.” It took Pietersen four years to find the courage to share her story after receiving counselling and medication for anxiety. “It is not a given that women will protect each other,” she said about these occasions that stood out clearly in her mind. In 2016 she was addicted to drugs and lived under a bridge. Her children were taken away from her. Pietersen was sexually abused from the age of 8 by a family member in a home in which her parents also lived. The abuse seemed to introduce her to the life of sex working and she accepted this as her way of earning money. 1000 Women Founder Tina Thiart said: “Louise is unique because she decided to reach out to other women to share her story and to inspire others to do the same. She uses her experience to support others. We need more women to step up.” Pietersen recently held her first three-day writing retreat at Mooi Bly cottages in Dal Josafat in the Boland and is completing her matric. Cape Argus
