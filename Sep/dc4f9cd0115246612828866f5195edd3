Cape own - Community Safety MEC Albert Fritz has called for calm in St Helena Bay amidst reports of planned protest action on Saturday under the banner of #JusticeforLeo. Leo Williams, 9, was shot in the head whilst sitting indoors, by a stray rubber bullet allegedly fired by a SAPS officer. Fritz further conveyed his heartfelt sympathies to the family and community on Williams' death. Fritz said that he has previously written to the office of the Provincial Commissioner, requesting further clarity on this matter and welcomed the investigation by Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID). “Going forward, I will closely monitor IPID’s recommendations into the investigation and liaise with the provincial Minister of Human Settlements on related service delivery complaints. “I will further engage with a local community leader to update him on these interventions in efforts to bring restore calm to the community.” Fritz added: “I call for calm amidst reports of planned protest action in St Helena Bay tomorrow. I urge residents to refrain from any protest action which is violent and/or causes damage to property as it is both illegal and criminal.” “I again wish to extend my heartfelt condolences to the family and loved ones of young Leo Williams. “No parent should have to bury their child. His death is a tragedy and has devastated the community as a whole,” the MEC said. Cape Argus
