Cape Town - Political parties and leaders involved in instigating illegal land grabs and land invasions in the Western Cape and elsewhere in the country must face the full might of the law, ACDP MPL Ferlon Christians said. Christians made the demand in a speech to the provincial legislature on Thursday. He pinned the blame for the invasions on the EFF, whose two MPLs were absent during the debate. “The EFF think they are above the law with their incitement when it comes to land grabs. We in the ACDP believe they should face the full force of the law. Examples must be made otherwise they will get out of control,” said Christians. Responding to the debate Human Settlements MEC Tertuis Simmers said land grabs did not benefit anyone. “The moment that land earmarked for housing development is illegally invaded, it can delay our process to deliver housing opportunities by anywhere from three months to five years, and in rare instances, even longer,” said Simmers “This is because it often requires lengthy and expensive litigation to remove the illegal invaders. "Every cent wasted on litigation means a cent less toward delivery to our law-abiding citizens.” ANC agriculture spokesperson Pat Marran said: “Land hunger is high in the Western Cape mostly because this province thinks it is a colonial entity on its own.” Good MPL Brett Herron said the problem was one of a failure of supply of housing opportunities in the face of overwhelming demand. “We continuously talk about rapid urbanisation but then act surprised and outraged when land is occupied in an unplanned way. "When human beings have nowhere else to be, and occupy land, we are confronted by the reality we have not planned a home for them. And we have created an environment ripe for exploitation." Cape Argus
