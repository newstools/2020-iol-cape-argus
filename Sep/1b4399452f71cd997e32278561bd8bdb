Cape Town - The EFF in the Western Cape has called for an urgent meeting with the management of the Astron Energy refinery in Milnerton which it has accused of failing to pay UIF Covid-19 Ters benefits to its employees. In a letter to Astron Energy, EFF provincial chairperson Melikhaya Xego said the company should know that it is illegal to claim Ters funds on behalf of workers and fail to pay that money back to the workers. “We are deeply concerned about what these workers are being subjected to and seek an urgent meeting with management,” said Xego. “We have also ascertained that some workers were partially paid while others were never paid at all. We would like to establish the rationale behind this non-payment. “Our labour desk has also established that the company had agreed with workers on a 10% increase rate before the Covid-19 lockdown and to date workers have not seen any signs of that 10%. Again, we would like to establish the reasons why.” Responding to the accusation, Astron corporate affairs manager Jill Koopman denied that Astron Energy had withheld Ters payments. “The individuals concerned were working for contracting companies at the Astron Energy refinery in Milnerton. They are not employed by Astron Energy,” said Koopman. “These contracting companies were providing short-term services during the refinery's shutdown for maintenance which occurs annually.” “We are committed to fair and legal labour practices for our own employees and those employed through contractors. We have been assured by the contractors that their processes in these instances were fair and legal.” Employment and Labour Department officials are working with affected employees and contracting companies to reach a resolution, she said.
