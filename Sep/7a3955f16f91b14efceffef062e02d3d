Cape Town - As many 30 families were left displaced after a  blaze at shacks in Pook Se Bos informal settlement in Gatesville on Tuesday. Spokesperson for Fire and Rescue Service, Jermaine Carelse, said the City’s Fire and Rescue Services responded to informal structures alight at the settlement, at 9:14pm. Eight  firefighting vehicles and a rescue vehicle attended to the fire with 30 staff battling the blaze, said Carelse. “Fire crews from Ottery, Wynberg, Gugulethu, Epping and Roeland Street fire stations managed to contain and extinguish the fire at 11:50pm.  Numerous structures were destroyed and persons were displaced.” Carelse said the cause of the fire was unknown and no injuries had been reported. Spokesperson for Disaster Risk Management Centre (DRMC), Charlotte Powell, said DRMC was in the process of assessing the number of persons affected and requested the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) to provide relief to those affected. Ward councillor Aslam Cassiem said: “Social Relief has been taken away from the City by the national government. Hence it has become a Sassa mandate. The City forwarded the affected or displaced dwellers’ details to Sassa, who then provided the social relief assistance.” Cassiem said providing housing for those displaced was being discussed and the tender process to initiate this would commence in October.
