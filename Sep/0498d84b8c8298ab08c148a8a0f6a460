Cape Town - Activists in Kraaifontein said the area being identified as a gender-based violence hot spot will not deter them from working to combat it. The newly formed Kraaifontein Development Forum said while it was dismayed with the community being identified in the top 30 in the country where the most gender-based violence occurred, it was not discouraged to work to uplift and assist Kraaifontein. Kraaifontein Development Forum secretary Louis Bophta said: “While we are extremely concerned that Kraaifontein was named among the top 30 GBV hot spots in the country, we are more than prepared to work within the community to assist families in need and combat the scourge of destructive violence. We intend to work with all necessary crime prevention bodies, such as our local CPF, the police and other stakeholders to not only raise awareness about GBV, but also to initiate programmes that will assist our community. “We recently met the Kraaifontein CPF to discuss a way forward that looks to empower and uplift the community. We are more than willing to do the work and will continue to advocate for our community”. Kraaifontein Community Policing Forum chairperson Mawethu Sila said that while the policing forum was deeply disturbed by being listed as a GBV hot spot, it was also prepared to work to combat violent crimes within the community. “As leaders, we care about the people who we stand for. We always try to the best of our abilities to protect and advocate for them. However, we face a few challenges along the way. Which is why it’s important to work with the actual residents themselves.” Cape Argus
