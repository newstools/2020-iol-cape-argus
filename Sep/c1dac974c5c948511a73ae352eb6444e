Cape Town – Car enthusiasts gathered on Saturday in memory of an 11-year-old-boy, Nahemiah Claasen, who died last week after he was wounded during gang crossfire. The community of Parkwood were left reeling after Nahemiah was struck in the head with a bullet while trying to run home during a rival gang shooting in Parkers Walk last Monday. Nahemiah was shot and lay wounded less than 5m from his home and died a day later in hospital. Abdul Mutalieb Pillay, 26, from Eagles Park, put out a call to what he referred to as “petrol heads” to join in the display of solidarity, especially for the children left traumatised by Nahemiah’s death. Between 30 and 50 vehicles met in Ottery, with images of Nahemiah’s name and face pasted onto them, and collectively rode to Parkwood, where Nahemiah was shot. “I have a son growing up in Manenberg and that could’ve been my son. I want kids to see that there is more to life than gangsterism,” said Pillay. “Most of them grow up thinking being a gangster is cool. I just want the kids to know there is another dream out there besides that.” His fascination with cars and their remodelling was largely the reason he had kept away from dangerous activities on the streets, he said. “There is hope. We just need to show our coloured communities this, and fight gangsterism and drugs.” Dozens of community and family members were present outside the Wynberg Magistrate’s court on Friday, where the two suspects accused of the murder, appeared. A 22-year-old murder suspect appeared in the Wynberg Magistrate’s court on Wednesday last week, together with two individuals who helped him evade an arrest, said police spokesperson, Andrè Traut. The suspect was in custody while the two alleged accomplices were granted bail. Cape Argus
