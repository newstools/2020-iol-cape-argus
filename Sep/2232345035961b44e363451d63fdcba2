Cape Town - Hannah’s Place of Safety, in Mitchells Plain, is calling on the public to assist in providing a temporary home to infants in need. Established in 2016, Hannah’s Place of Safety serves as a safe house for newborn babies up to one year old, for a duration of six months. It provides temporary care and shelter for neglected and abused infants until they are able to be placed in foster care or adopted. Founder and director Janine Fabe had refurbished a part of her home in order to accommodate around six infants at a time. She said: “We provide all their needs - love and lots of care as if they are our own children, clothing, formula, medical, visits to social development for family visits if requested, 24/7 care with a staff complement of eight carers.” The non-profit organisation also offers an emergency service to police or social workers (or 24 to 48 hours) should an infant be found abandoned and in need of care. Fabe said individuals who want to take up the role as a temporary safety care parent need to make sure they are able to provide for the child’s every need. “The children come from difficult circumstances already and we as safety care parents should not be inflicting more hardship.” She advised making sure that you have enough food, clothes, space, patience and time to offer, as well as a safe and loving environment. No payment will be offered or made to those interested in becoming a safety care parent and the duration for care required is between three and six months. Social worker in the Department of Social Development (DSD), Nondumiso Dludla, based in Mitchells Plain, said the DSD in Mitchells Plain is looking for women/ families interested in becoming safety parents for a short term. “The organisation cares for the vulnerable children who are in need of care and protection,” said Dludla. Anyone interested in the programme can contact Dludla on 0210012674 or 0727794626. Cape Argus
