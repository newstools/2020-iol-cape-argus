Cape Town - Families across the Cape are gearing up to return to their usual summer end-of-year activities, especially following Wednesday’s announcement by President Cyril Ramaphosa, that the country would be going to level 1 lockdown as of midnight on Sunday. As the weather clears up and recreational spaces begin to open up again, families across the city have resumed their end-of-year summer preparations just in time for the country to go into lockdown level 1. The City of Cape Town has been in the process of preparing its recreational venues in preparation for summer. Mayco member for Community Services and Health, Zahid Badroodien, said: “Preparations are under way to open municipal swimming pools for the summer season. Generally, swimming pools open in October and close in April, corresponding with the recruitment and placement of lifeguards, as well as to allow for maintenance and upgrades during the off-peak season. “An announcement will be made by the Recreation and Parks Department soon, confirming the dates when municipal swimming pools will officially open for the 2020/ 2021 summer season once lifeguards are in place and staff resume operations based on a Return to Work Plan, which is a legal requirement to ensure that health and safety adjustments for Covid-19 are made and in effect prior to facilities being opened to the public.” Meanwhile, National Sea Rescue Institute spokesperson Craig Lambinon said the voluntary non-profit organisation would continue to monitor local beaches as per its usual mandate over the course of the year. “We will continue to monitor the sea and local beaches 24/7, 365 days a year, as we usually do. We have teams on standby and ready to facilitate operations,” said Lambinon. Cape Argus
