Cape Town - Government solutions which involve “throwing money at the problem” have been questioned by the Freedom Front Plus (FF+) in the Western Cape legislature. FF+ member Peter Marais made the statement during a virtual public hearing on the Social Assistance Amendment Bill before the standing committee on social development. Marais said he was worried that giving “more and more money” in child support and foster care would be creating problems instead of solving them. “To what extent is this solution abused? Does it contribute to the high rate of pregnancies among unwed mothers, especially in rural areas? “I have come across situations where young mothers have four or five children because they rely on the children’s grant. We are trying to say we’ll protect the children, but the only answer we have is every year to give them R20 more. Are we addressing the real problems here?” asked Marais. Molebogeng Unisi, from the National Department of Social Services, responded: “Increasing the child support grant, especially for orphans and children in child-headed households, will assist to ensure that issues around vulnerability are reduced."
