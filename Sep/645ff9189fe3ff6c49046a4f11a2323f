Cape Town - The tourism industry requires innovative ways to ensure revenue is being generated by the sector, so air cargo will be taken advantage of while passenger transport remains low. The City of Cape Town recently launched a Tourism Bounce Back Strategy aimed at Cape Town’s tourism and related sectors. Wesgro hosted a webinar with the City to discuss ways to increase demand for Cape products. Air cargo was found to be the avenue to best pursue during the pandemic. Mayco member for economic opportunities and asset management, James Vos, said: “According to information, there is an opportunity for Cape Town to leverage the fact that airlines are looking to air cargo to help generate revenue while passenger numbers remain low. We are also working to help stimulate supply and demand for Cape Town products.” Vos said they were working to position Cape Town as the springboard into Africa and beyond because of the world-class airport currently undergoing expansion and the well-located harbour. “Connectivity forms part of our Tourism Development Framework 2024 and our objective is to connect Cape Town with key destinations. Connecting Cape Town to more cities and countries is key to creating more jobs through tourism and also provides trade opportunities to export more proudly local products to the rest of the world,” he said. The City has renewed funding for the Cape Town Air Access and Acsa which will help with Cape Town’s recovery process post-Covid-19. Vos said: “Another opportunity has arisen from the growth in the e-commerce sector due to the pandemic. As discussed, air cargo and e-commerce support each other and are a key opportunity to take advantage of. Cape Argus
