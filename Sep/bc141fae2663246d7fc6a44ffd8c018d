Cape Town – Kraaifontein residents are calling out the City for alleged third-rate repairs to broken sewer systems. Swelleni Street residents in Kraaifontein say they have been living with sewage flowing in their streets for the past few months. Kraaifontein resident Khunjulwa Sinono said she first reported the broken sewer system in front of her home in June but received no feedback until she logged another complaint later in the same month. “We are living in the midst of filth in this community. After numerous calls to the City for help, we are tired of receiving little to no response. “We have complained time and time again about the sewer systems that are blocked in our streets and when the City comes to fix the problem the systems block again within five minutes of their departure.” “Sewage drains are flooding and human faeces is flowing in front of our yards and on to our doorsteps. “We have children and the elderly, we are falling sick because of this mess and our calls are going unheard.” She said the problems were exacerbated on rainy days with water flowing into their homes and leaving surrounding areas damp and a haven for mosquitoes. Kraaifontein councillor Simpiwe Nonkeziyama said: “I have contacted the City countless times to report and follow up on calls for assistance made by residents to the City, to no avail. “Yes, the City once in a while sends out technicians to fix the broken sewer systems; however, the systems break again after a short while. “I don’t understand whether the work being done to repair the broken systems is not enough, or if the technicians leave before they complete their tasks. “I live within the community and I see the terrible situation first hand. Something needs to be done urgently before an outbreak of diseases” added Nonkeziyama. In response, the City said it was probing the allegations and would be able to give a response after thoroughly checking with all the involved parties. Cape Argus
