Cape Town - Protestors arrested on Saturday during a protest against gender-based violence (GBV) near Parliament appeared in the Cape Town Magistrate’s Court on Monday. The case against the 13, accused of public violence and violating the Disaster Management Act, was postponed to October 13. Callum Ryan Beukes, who took part in the protest, said: “At the point when I was arrested, we were sitting peacefully in the middle of the road while the police held their rifles and kept on pushing the crowd back. They shot at us, and used flash grenades and tear gas against us.” There have been conflicting accounts as to what led to violence during the protest, including that bikers hijacked the anti-GBV protest to protest against farm murders. Beukes, 18, said he was pushed, shoved and kicked by police officers. Police spokesperson FC Van Wyk said: “The Cape Town police are investigating cases of public violence, malicious damage to property, transgressions relating to the Disaster Management Act and an attempted murder” @TheCapeArgus @IOL He said at the police station where those arrested were taken, they were given no food or water for more than 12 hours. Another protester, Ryan Piper, said they were placed in a cell. “We were kept there for so long but they treated us like animals. As a group we are considering laying charges with the Independent Police Investigative Directorate,” he said. The accused were released without bail and warned to appear in court next month. According to the state prosecutor, police affidavits were not available and the magistrate was asked to postpone the matter. Cape Argus
