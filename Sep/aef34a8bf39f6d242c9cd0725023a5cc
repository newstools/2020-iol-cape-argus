Bonang Matheba and Tebogo "Pinky Girl" Mekgwe won our hearts in ’Being Bonang’, offering one-liners that left the Twitterverse in a frenzy. While Bonang confirmed that ’Being Bonang’ won’t return for season 4, it hasn't stopped us from wanting a Bonang X Pinky Girl travel show, which we hope will become a reality when international borders open soon. Here are five reasons why we will watch a Bonang and Pinky Girl travel show: Their chemistry is undeniable Bonang and Pinky Girl are cousin goals. There's undeniable chemistry whenever they appear in a scene together, which will offer many fun-filled moments on camera and as they explore a new destination. Queen B will choose only the best destinations Bonang is the queen of travel, regularly travelling to destinations like France, New York and Prague, to name but a few. We'd love to see the pair travel to locations within South Africa, whether it's a beach trip to Durban, an adventure weekend in the Garden Route or a luxury spa weekend in the Western Cape. We hope they also explore Africa- from Lagos to Cairo. The House Of BNG. 🥂👑 #MissSA2019 A post shared by  Bonang Matheba (@bonang_m) on Aug 12, 2019 at 5:18am PDT One-liners for days They are the queens of one-liners, and a travel show will introduce us to a new travel language. I am pretty sure they would make tons of money if they came up with a travel t-shirt range baring those one-liners. We want to know their travel tips and hacks I mean, who wouldn't want to know how Bonang and Pinky Girl pack for a trip, or what their secret hacks are when they explore a new destination? We want to know it all and then some.
