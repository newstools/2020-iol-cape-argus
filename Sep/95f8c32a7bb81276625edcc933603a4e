It started with a simple tweet from radio host Thabo Mokwele. “What do you prefer in bed, vocal or silent sex? Why are (most) men silent during sex? And why is English the default language in bed?” Asking very important questions, Mokwele needed answers. Using the hashtag #WhyMenAreSilentDuringSex, the tweet started trending within a matter of hours, with many social media users offering their own theories.
