An open letter to the Minister of Police Dear Minister Cele, I write this letter with grave concern. As a representative of a community with a known mistrust of SAPS as an entity I need to draw your attention to the recent action of the Anti-Gang Unit. Hardly a day goes by without some type of whisper of random assault by members of what was intended to be a grouping of police officers supposedly used to combat the scourge of drugs. According to our sources the AGU faces 2500 assault charges. If this is indeed true then I’m sure we can agree the number is excessive, we don’t live in a police state after all. A further cause for concern is that in its two years of existence the AGU has not achieved a single conviction. Mr Minister, for all the beatings, all the doors broken down and all the arrests not a single gang member has been sentenced to a day in prison. In short, the AGU is an expense we the people and SAPS as an entity cannot afford. Mr Minister, we live in a war zone, an entity such as the AGU is needed. But it needs to be profitable, we demand better results. * Fadiel Adams, Cape Coloured Congress ** The views expressed here are not necessarily those of Independent Newspapers.
