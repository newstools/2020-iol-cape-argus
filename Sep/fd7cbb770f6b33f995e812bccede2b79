CAPE TOWN - The Western Cape MEC of Social Development, Sharna Fernandez, said her department is commemorating World Suicide Prevention Day on Thursday to promote its commitment and action to prevent suicides. In a statement released on Thursday, Fernandez said many individuals find themselves contemplating suicide due to ongoing stress, trauma and/or as a consequence of dealing with mental health issues such as depression or anxiety. She said although there is no single reason as to why people find themselves in those situations, what is known is that many people are not aware of how to seek help and support. Fernandez said the Covid-19 pandemic has also contributed to people’s feelings of self-isolation and anxiety, which may trigger increasing thoughts of suicide. With the pandemic still in force, she said it was more important than ever to talk about one’s feelings. She urged the public to be kind to the next person at all times, as one never knows what the next person is facing in silence. She said her department, with support from its non-profit organisations (NPO) and its volunteers, has been engaged in suicide awareness programmes. She said the department has formed partnerships with NPO partners, civil society organisations (CSO) and faith-based organisations to establish support groups for individuals and families in need of support in vulnerable communities. Fernandez said psycho-social support and bereavement counselling is being provided by her department to families and individuals and has been tailored to meet the specific needs of each individual. This support includes counselling, psychotherapy, debriefing and cognitive behavioural therapy. African News Agency (ANA)
