Cape Town - A Kraaifontein resident is gearing up to trek to the Northern Cape to raise awareness about cancer, raise funds for a cancer patient, and give hope to those who have the disease. Michael Wynne, 55, from Scottsville, Kraaifontein, is to embark on his fourth cancer awareness campaign in a few days’ time. He will walk and hitch-hike to Koingnaas in the Northern Cape, a distance of nearly 600km, to raise funds for a young woman from the small community who is battling cancer. In remission from cancer himself, having suffered from colon and prostate cancer, Wynne said he was motivated to raise awareness about cancer and uplift those who had the disease,as well as their families. On his campaigns, he said: “I wanted to uplift people and share with them my journeys as a form of encouragement. Cancer is not the end of your life, and that is exactly what we sometimes need to hear when I read about the young woman from Koingnaas, I immediately wanted to do something to help her.” And Wynne’s fourth campaign has drawn support. Cape Crews Movement Car Crew have vowed to back Wynne’s awareness journey, pledging to support him with two separate car shows. Chairperson Vincent Coupriers said: “We will do everything we can, to the best of our ability, to help Wynne. His campaign is more than just an informative one; it is kind and selfless. We fully support him and all those who are battling cancer.” Cape Argus
