Cape Town - An electrical fault is believed to be the cause of the fire that gutted part of the Langa’s famous tourist attraction, Guga S’thebe cultural centre, on Wednesday. The facility was set to open on Thursday and while it was being fixed, it started burning after an electrical fault. The centre is dedicated to the empowerment of the people of Langa and improving their socio-economic situation. Residents are trained at the centre in several skills and arts such as metalwork and pottery. The theatre offers dance, arts and craft lessons, traditional dancing, choir training, music and poetry, and hosts regular local and national art exhibitions. City Fire and Rescue Service spokesperson Jermaine Carelse said they responded at 9.46am. He said the firefighters managed to contain and extinguish the fire at 12.16pm and no injuries were reported. #Emthonjeni Arts Productions founder Luyolo Lengisi said the fire was a huge blow to the community and the youth depended on it to earn money. “We have been waiting for the facility to open since the tourism sector has been open for business. “We have been using the space for our rehearsals and shows rent free “We now fear that once the space is fixed there might be changes and we will not be allowed to access it again,’’ Lengisi said. He said it would be a loss to a lot of young people as it helped them find their voices through arts and culture. “The space was also instrumental in ensuring that we were exposed to different tourists who visited the facility.” Lengisi said with September being Tourism and Heritage Month the facility would have hosted a series of cultural events.
