Cape Town - The Khayelitsha Site C Youth Forum held a dialogue on accountability among young leaders in an effort to give recognition to budding entrepreneurs and leaders, and offer them support. The organisation’s project convener, Mboneleli Ggirana, said that the youth forum was approached by Accountability Lab and invited to host the dialogue to encourage and motivate young women and men from the community to become exemplary leaders who understood the meaning of accountability within their respective spaces. “This was something we had in mind to do but unfortunately could not follow through on because we lacked the funding. However, as soon as we were approached we were glad to do it. “Hosting the dialogue was but part of what we had to do. We were also supported in our venture by Khaltsha Cycles and the Khayelitsha Site C CAN (Community Action Network),” said Ggirana. He said Khaltsha Cycles donated 10 bicycles to not only assist entrepreneurs in their business ventures but to enable them to practise active citizenship by supporting the elderly and running errands for residents recovering from Covid-19. One of the bicycle recipients was 26-year-old Sandile Ngwayi, who is the founder and owner of two businesses, Ijeje, a meat-braaiing concern, and Born Ready African Group, a local marketing start-up. “The bicycle was a welcome addition to the knowledge and support shared with us by the Khayelitsha Site C Youth Forum. I began using mine as soon as I received it. “I am so grateful for the opportunity, and couldn't be more excited to grow my businesses further using this mode of transportation. Ijeje delivers braaied meat to our customers, and with the bicycle I can do that timeously,” he said. Cape Argus
