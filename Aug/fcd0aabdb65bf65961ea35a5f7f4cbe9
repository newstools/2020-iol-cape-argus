Does lockdown have you walking to the fridge every few hours? You’re not alone. In fact, many of us find ourselves staring longingly into the depths, hoping a chocolate will magically appear. One Atlanta woman has even gone and made a song out of it. KD French’s song “at the fridge again" went viral after posting it to social media. With a vocal range to rival Mariah Carey, French has gained quite the following on social media, and now she’s using her talent for something we can all relate to - the walk of shame to the fridge. After posting the video to her YouTube account last week, it raked up more than a million views. Most were blown away by the power of her voice, but impressed that she managed to pull off a song about a fridge. “This needs to be on a Smart Fridge,” commented one user. Another said: “I'm done! This girl made a song about being at the refrigerator and it was in harmony and on point!  I'm so done! I love it!!” “I keep watching this and looking at a different square each time.” News outlets across the US have been eager to feature French. When asked about the success of the song on WSBTV, she said: “It was a bit overwhelming, but overwhelming joy.”
