An image of a great white shark shows the highest breach through the water ever recorded. The shot, captured by shark expert Chris Fallows, shows the great white shark hanging 15 feet (about 4.5m) in the air as it sinks its teeth into what looks like a fish.

According to the Daily Mail, the researchers tracked the sharks with a drone while Fallows used a purpose-built tow camera. Fallows spoke about the epic moment in an article published in the Daily Mail. "They say a picture is worth a thousand words. Well, that picture is worth a thousand breaches. I can't believe how high it came out, it was just perfect ... a photo you dream of. This has to be the ultimate air jaws breach,' said Fallows.
