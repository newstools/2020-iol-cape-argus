Local comedian Tyson Ngubeni really knows how to keep us in stitches. His unique brand of humour had us laughing into our hot peri-peri wings when he featured in Nando’s new ad. Now Ngubeni has taken to social media to reminisce about a childhood delicacy most of us can relate to - the beloved bompie. Taking on the persona of special correspondent Bob O'Connor,  Ngubeni introduces his followers to the sweetness of childhood years gone by. “It’s not a truly South African summer without an abundance of ice. Not the rapper, Vanilla, and not the box where Omarian’s heart used to be,” says the actor. Ngubeni then takes out a “frozen, fruity delight”, AKA, an ice bompie. Going into its history, he describes how little it cost. “It accomplishes what any soda commercial would have you believe - a guaranteed cooling quench,” he says.

The video elicited many funny responses, with other online users relaying their own stories. 😂 I have stories to tell about this legend.My late gran used to make them with Oros. Best thing ever! We got them for free 😁  'bompie' 🤣🤣🤣 @tysonngubeni  jou lekker ding 🤣🤣🤣  It seems like it's only in Pretoria & Rustenburg were it's called Lepopotane. That's because it's hard, or e popota. Anywhere else?  Phela on weekends you never got pocket money so you take loose change from under the vase🤣🤣. Money the rents would leave for ukuthenga isinkwa. Or was it just me ☠️☠️
