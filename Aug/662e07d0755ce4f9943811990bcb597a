by Colin Bosman The reason, whether we like him or not, that Donald Trump is politically successful is that he leads from the front. The same applies to leaders in Brazil, China and Russia. Cyril Ramaphosa is hamstrung by the top NEC members who were dragged in from the old Zuma camp. He tiptoes around them in order to appease the ANC members on the ground who put them in place, so he has no option. However, it benefits only the ANC and not the country nor its people . With the elections looming next year, the time is right for Ramaphosa to cut his losses and take charge of the Cabinet. It will split the ANC certainly, but it’s split anyway with Ace Magashule dancing around in the shadows undermining Ramaphosa’s efforts to do his job. A bold move by Ramaphosa to cut the top NEC down to size is no longer an option, but a necessity as the country prepares for a coalition government next year. He is the only man standing in the way of a return to the Zuma era and he needs to move decisively and swiftly. A bold move now will ensure that history will judge him kindly. * Colin Bosman, Newlands. ** The views expressed here are not necessarily those of Independent Media.
