Thank you for affording the City the opportunity to respond to the article “Awarding of Cape health service contract to once-blacklisted company questioned” (August 5, Cape Argus). The City refutes the assertion made that the City contracted Top N Nos’ services while the company was blacklisted. This is grossly false. The City did not do business with the company while it was a restricted supplier. As was mentioned in the article, this company was restricted some years ago by the National Treasury for a short period. During this time, the City made no awards to the company. However, the restriction was lifted after the company approached the court, and they are no longer listed as a restricted vendor with the National Treasury. The company currently has contracts with the City of Cape Town for cleaning services as they are no longer restricted. All contracts are awarded transparently and in line with Municipal Finance Management Act legislation and supply chain principles, and are open to public scrutiny and go through rigorous legal processes. Legally, the City has no basis to reject their tender if they are fully compliant. * Luthando Tyhalibongo, City of Cape Town spokesperson. ** The views expressed here are not necessarily those of Independent Media.
