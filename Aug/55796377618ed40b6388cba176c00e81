Cape Town - A woman from Bloekombos was shot and killed during an altercation between land invaders and a private property owner in Kraaifontein. Land invasions and violent protests have been taking place in Bloekombos, and over the weekend 14 people were arrested on charges of public violence and related crimes. Police spokesperson Novela Potelwa said police were investigating the shooting of the woman on the premises of a trucking business in Old Paarl Road on Saturday afternoon after about 500 protesters stormed the premises following the torching of a light delivery vehicle. Potelwa said: “The police have opened a murder investigation into the death of a 19-year-old Bloekombos resident after she was shot inside the premises of a trucking business... As the investigation continued, a 62-year-old man was subsequently arrested on Saturday evening. The shooting incident followed ongoing protests that are linked to the demolition of structures by the City’s law enforcement officials on a piece of land in Kraaifontein.” Potelwa said officers from the public order unit who were deployed to the area prevented the group from invading the business. Kraaifontein councillor Simpiwe Nonkeziyama said that the death of the young woman was a great loss that could have been avoided. “We are very saddened and troubled about the death of yet another young woman. We sympathise with and wish the family comfort as they grieve the loss of a loved one.” Nonkeziyama said to avoid any more unfortunate incidents and the continuation of violent protests in the community, the government should work with communities to find a just and suitable solution.
