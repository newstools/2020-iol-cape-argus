by Keith Blake An open letter to communities and every government department: It has become a habit that when some people are unhappy with service delivery, they employ scorched earth policy. One cannot comprehend why schools, hospitals and government properties are set alight. It has become a pandemic. Also out of control is illegal dumping. Certain residents report these illegal dumpings. They're cleaned up but as soon as the dirt is removed, illegal dumping resumes. As community members in our respective suburbs, do we truly and realistically realise what are the results for all of us when it comes to burning of government property, and the consequences of attacking emergency staff and their vehicles? When some of us burn down a school, where are our children going to be educated? It means that the parents have to find another school in another area. If another school is far away, it means extra unaffordable transport costs and the new uniforms. Attacking emergency staff like firefighters could mean they are no more prepared to render speedy life-saving services due to fear. Illegal dumping allows for germs to breed rapidly. We must consider what happens when things cannot be replaced due to finances, or if the powers that be wash their hands of the continual destruction in communities.
