by Thulani Dasa Choosing a DA metro regional chairperson is the first important decision voters need to make for this great city. When you're in the Civic Centre, weighing the toughest issues, and the choice you make will affect the lives and livelihoods of the entire city, you need someone with you who's got the judgement and the character to make the right call. Someone whose focus goes beyond self-interest to consider the lives and prospects of others. A Dan Plato decision will bring back stability, inclusivity and trust to the many people of Cape Town. Reality shows us that these attributes are not optional in a mayor. They’re requirements of the job. As DA metro regional chairperson, Dan will help tackle the very real challenges faced right now, and in the years ahead. I’ve known Dan for a long time. He is more than prepared for the job. He’s spent his career defending our Constitution and fighting for everyone who needs a fair share in life. His own life story is one that I and so many others can see ourselves in: a story that says that no matter where you come from, what you look like, how you worship, or who you love, there’s a place for you here. It’s a fundamentally Cape Town perspective, one that’s led us out of the hardest times before, and it’s a perspective we can all rally behind right now. This is a great choice for our city and its residents. Now let’s go win this thing. * Thulani Dasa, Khayelitsha. ** The views expressed here are not necessarily those of Independent Media.
