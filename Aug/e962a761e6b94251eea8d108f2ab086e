Cape Town - In an effort to promote domestic tourism in the province, the Western Cape government and Wesgro will be launching the “We are Open” campaign today. The campaign highlights the best that the Western Cape has to offer, and showcases how the province can easily match experiences on offer elsewhere in the world. This as the province recorded an additional seven deaths, bringing the total number of Covid-19-related deaths to 3868. As of 1pm on Sunday, the Western Cape had 4048 active cases of Covid-19, with a total of 104973 confirmed cases and 97057 recoveries. To date 481737 tests have been conducted while 2293 cases are unallocated. The number of hospitalised patients stands at 790, with 161 in ICU or high care. Premier Alan Winde said tourism was a key sector in the Western Cape creating thousands of jobs, and the impact of the lockdown had been severe. “Thousands of jobs have been lost in the tourism sector, and your support can help to save jobs now. If you can afford to, we call on you to visit a local tourism attraction in your city, book a tour to experience a neighbourhood you’ve never visited or enjoy a weekend away in our province,” he said. Tomorrow the Table Mountain Cableway will reopen for visitors, as will the Two Oceans Aquarium. “Last week, a number of the Department of Cultural Affairs and Sports’ affiliated museums received the go-ahead to reopen their doors, among them Togryers Museum in Ceres, Caledon Museum, the Huguenot Memorial in Franschhoek, the Lwandle Migrant Labour Museum, the Shipwreck Museum in Bredasdorp and Stellenbosch Museum. Several others are awaiting the go-ahead to reopen.” Winde called on travellers to take precautions so that the sector could open safely. Cape Argus
