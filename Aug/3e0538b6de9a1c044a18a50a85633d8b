by Councillor Mark RH Kleinschmidt Sadly, while we celebrate the last few days of women's achievements this August, two more young women have been murdered. Amahle Quku, a 17-year-old from Philippi, and 22-year-old Nomvuzo Atoli from Siyanyanzela informal settlement, have become the latest victims of horrendous gender-based violence - a pandemic of astronomical proportions. Many NGOs and gender groups have spoken out during Women's Month for the thousands of voiceless victims. Our church has been hosting a series of Bible-based talks tackling the scourge of GBV. Testimonies by women brought us to tears as we lamented and comforted one another. More men need to speak out against femicide and GBV, and faith-based organisations provide an ideal platform. It was enlightening when we lamented the brutality and rape suffered by Old Testament women Ester and Tamar, who endured terrible abuse at the hands of men. Ironically, in many cases of GBV inflicted on women, the perpetrators are either known to or in a relationship with the victims. Women must speak out: #Enough is Enough and #RealMenDontRape. The judiciary and courts must exercise the full might of the law to implement harsher sentences. No bail must be granted to rapists, as mentioned by President Cyril Ramaphosa. * CouncillorÂ Mark RH Kleinschmidt, Kenwyn. ** The views expressed here are not necessarily those of Independent Media.
