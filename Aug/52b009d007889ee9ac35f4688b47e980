Cape Town - A Covid-19 patient who spent 69 days at Groote Schuur Hospital, of which 33 were spent in a critical condition in the ICU ward, was discharged last week after receiving the thumbs up. Victoria Base, 63, from Gugulethu was discharged on Friday. After presenting with severe Covid-19 pneumonia, Base was taken to the Heideveld Emergency Centre on May 23, and was then immediately transferred to Groote Schuur to be admitted to the ICU. Intensivists Professor Ivan Joubert and Dr Jenna Piercy, both of whom oversaw her care in the ICU ward, said: “There were many occasions when we thought she might not pull through, and thus we are delighted to see her ready to leave the hospital.” Base required minor surgical procedures after ICU, and physiotherapy to get her mobile and ready to return home. On the day of her discharge, Base said: “Having a nice home-cooked meal will be the first thing I will want when I get home. Thank you to all the staff for their help and kindness. I will remember you for the rest of my life. “I will tell my family and the community about the good work you did.” Her message to the public was simple: “Covid-19 does not choose who it wants to infect, be aware of everything you do and please be cautious. “I survived, but others have not been so fortunate.” Cape Argus
