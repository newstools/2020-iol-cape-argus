Well, if you do, the 6 bedroom and 6 bath home located at 21 Nettleton in Clifton Bay would be one to remember.

Included in your stay are housekeeping, airport transfer, a chef, butler and your own personal driver.  If that doesn't entice you, picture yourself on a lounger while listening to the "waterfall cascading past boulders into the pool" while your personal chef and butler fix you something to eat. Then take a stroll through a " winding red-carpet staircase past statues and oil paintings to your suite" for a cup of tea or a refreshing cocktail. If you want to explore the surrounding area, a driver can whisk you to Clifton or Camps Bay beaches in minutes. When you come back from exploring, make use of the hammam, the pool, sauna or laze around on the sunbed. There's even a piano available if you feel the urge to play a classic or two.
