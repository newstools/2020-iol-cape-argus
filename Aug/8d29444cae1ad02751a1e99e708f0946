Cape Town - The dams supplying the Cape metro are on an upward curve with the city’s dam levels increasing to 88%, a 4% rise from the 84% of the previous week. Mayco member for water and waste, Xanthea Limberg, said at the same time last year, dam levels were at 81.7%. “The downpours of the previous weeks have created a welcome boost to our dams levels. “This further recovery of dams is encouraging, but it is important to note that current capacity is not a result of rainfall alone, but also the sustained reduction in water consumption,” said Limberg. “A decision on restriction levels for the 2020/21 hydrological year will be taken on review of the rainy season, which ends on October 31, in consultation with the national department of water and sanitation and other users of the Western Cape Water Supply System. “Consumption for the same period increased by 19 million litres per day from an average of 642 million litres per day the previous week to 661 million litres per day.” Meanwhile, Local Government, Environmental Affairs and Development Planning MEC Anton Bredell continues to urge Captonians to use water responsibly. The Theewaterskloof Dam, the largest dam in the province, is currently standing at 84.96%, a 10% increase compared to 71% at the same time last year.
