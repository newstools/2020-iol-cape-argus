Cape Town â€“ The family of Nomvuzo Atoll, 22, from Philippi are struggling to come to terms with her death after her body was discovered in a rubbish container. Atoll's body was found on Thursday morning at Siyanyanzela informal settlement in Philippi, in Albert Luthuli Street. This is also where the  bruised body of Amahle Quku, 18, was found on June 20. Just like Quku's family, Atoll's family also found out about her death after pictures of her body was posted on Facebook. "My brother showed me the pictures on Facebook and we went to the scene. Her body was neatly dressed with no shoes on her feet. We just noticed bruises on her head," her distraught aunt Nandipha Shosha said. She said Atoll had buried her mother three months ago. "She was never a problematic child. She was a hair stylist, that is how she made money for herself." Shosha said Atoll was hoping to study at the University of Cape Town next year. "Some people told us that she was heard fighting with a man last (on Wednesday) night." Police spokesperson Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said Nyanga police had opened a case of murder for investigation. Rwexana said, according to reports, the community alerted police of the discovery at the dumping site. "The circumstances surrounding this incident are under investigation with no arrests so far," Rwexana said. Xolisa Pukayi, community activist and Philippi East ward committee member for safety and security, said: "This is a tragedy because after Quku's death, I thought the City of Cape Town would have endorsed more structures such as Gender Based Violence to educate our people that to kill our women and children in our society is not acceptable." sisonke.mlamla@inl.co.za Cape Argus
