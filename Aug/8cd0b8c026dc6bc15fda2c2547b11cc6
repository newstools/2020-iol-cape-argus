Meanwhile, Health MEC Nomafrench Mbombo was a participant in the “Leading Women in Africa” webinar series hosted by Africa Liberal Network and Réseau Libéral Africain. The series looked at notable women on the continent and discussed ways in which gender equality could be realised by 2030. Speaking about how her department prepared itself to the manage the pandemic, Mbombo said: “When it landed in SA, Cape Town was dubbed as a ‘Wuhan’. I think for us, we have to credit our team because the team is not only my colleagues, but we have incredible staff in the health setting. “What was crucial for us was keeping the ‘whole of government’ approach. So it’s not a health problem because you have to keep on educating people that while the health system must absorb it and our health system must be strengthened, and the preparedness in terms of the readiness of beds, they need to understand that there will be humanitarian issues and job-related issues when people are in a lockdown and unable to access economic opportunities. “Government alone won’t be able to do this. We need businesses, people who have resources and private health, especially with regards to providing critical care.” Cape Argus
