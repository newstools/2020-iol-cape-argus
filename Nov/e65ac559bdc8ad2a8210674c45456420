by Michael Bagraim It is not often I agree with Cosatu but in this instance I certainly do. The monies in the Department of Employment and Labour which are used to pay the UIF Covid-19 Temporary Employer/ Employee Relief Scheme (Ters) claims do not belong to the government but to the workers themselves. The money is there specifically for “a rainy day”. If ever there was a rainy day it’s now. The workers are being battered from both sides. The retrenchments are ongoing and probably the worst they have been, and the non- payment due to the lockdown has been in excess of seven months. For the president to make a silly decision in not extending the Ters payment beyond October is beyond belief. It appears strongly that the government does not care about the workers of South Africa. * Michael Bagraim, Highlands Estate. ** The views expressed here are not necessarily those of Independent Media.
