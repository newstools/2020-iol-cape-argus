Cape Town - City of Cape Town firefighters are being lauded for their swift response after they helped deliver a baby on a roof on Tuesday morning. In a statement, mayoral committee member for safety and security JP Smith said the  crew from Belhar Fire Station received a call just before 5am and when they got to the address, found a woman in labour on the roof of the house. According to Smith, the roof was the only way the woman could get out of the yard from the residence. She shortly gave birth to a baby boy. “Staff clamped and cut the baby’s umbilical cord, and monitored his vitals until the rescue vehicle arrived from Epping Fire Station,” Smith said. “Firefighters also assisted the mom and baby from the roof.” The mother and newborn baby were transported to hospital soon afterwards. This is not the first time members of this fire crew have stepped up to help a baby. On October 9, a two-week-old baby boy was brought to the fire station by his family,  unresponsive and not breathing. The crew members sprang into action and gave the baby cardiopulmonary resuscitation, after which he started breathing again. Once stable, the child was transported to Tygerberg Hospital in Parow by ambulance. At the time, Smith commended the crew for saving the young baby’s life. “Our emergency services exist to ensure the safety and well-being of all our residents and it is heart-warming to know that the community can turn to our services when in need,” he said.
