Cape Town - The community of Atlantis is reeling after the killing of 16-year-old Jordan Moore, a Grade 10 pupil at Robinvale High School in Atlantis. Jordan’s body was found on Friday allegedly with stab wounds, his teeth knocked out and bite wounds, presumably from a pit bull, as well as a chain around his neck. Police spokesperson Andrè Traut said circumstances surrounding the death were under investigation after his body was discovered at around 10.30pm in Rietsanger Ave, Robinvale. Traut said the motive for the murder was yet to be established and no arrests had been made. DA PR councillor Allister Lightburn said three boys were sitting in a park when two gun-wielding gangsters with a pit bull approached them and demanded they buy alcohol for them at a nearby tavern. He said two of the boys escaped and reported the incident. Jordan’s body was found in bushes away from the park near a soccer field in the area with his ear bitten off and stab wounds to the chest, he said. “For your child to be taken in such a manner is brutal. The family are still in shock; he was the eldest grandson.” Lightburn said gang-related incidents were prevalent in the area. “A month ago another 16-year old was gunned down after his brother was also gunned down less than five months before. And not so long ago a 12-year-old was also gunned down in a gang-related shooting. There is also a new trend in the area where people are getting robbed by gangsters with pit bulls and young boys getting recruited to gangs,” he said. Community safety MEC Albert Fritz condemned the incident. Cape Argus
