Cape Town - Two mobile toilets stationed in front of an Early Childhood Development centre in Phase 2, Wallacedene, allegedly dropped off by the City officials have angered the centre management and parents. Shiloh Themba Kids ECD project manager Alfred Venter said the toilets were dropped off on Friday without any notification, permission or consideration for the health and wellbeing of the children, parents or visitors of the centre. Venter said the toilets would be allegedly servicing more than 200 people who recently moved in on a park next to the centre. “The parents of these children were furious. The other problem is that we are also experiencing constant overflowing of sewage on the street right in front of the centre. I have raised this with the municipality numerous times and it has not been resolved. This creates an unhealthy environment to teach and raise children,” Venter said. Venter said the toilets were not locked, which posed a security risk to the teachers, staff and children of being attacked by criminals hiding inside them. “They should have consulted us. We understand that they are in the municipal grounds but they need to consider we work with children aged 3 to 6.” Mayoral Member for waste and water Xanthea Limberg said the City delivered the new toilets to the community at the request of the ward councillor. The City regularly delivered new units in informal settlement pockets due to increased demand. “Normally the City will consult with the community on a suitable location. This incident is being investigated.” Limberg said the City was in consultation with the community leadership to identify a suitable location. Cape Argus
