Cape Town - A Cape Town-based not-for-profit testicular cancer awareness campaign is raising funds to develop an educational cancer app for schools in the hope of teaching young people about testicular health and cancer in general. Love Your Nuts founder and campaigner Torsten Koehler said: “We run a cancer school programme, called Cancer Smart, where children from grades 3 to 12 learn about where to find help if they are diagnosed with cancer. The programme is about cancer in general, and not just testicular cancer.” “The logistics of getting this programme to schools nationwide is quite a challenge. This is why we decided to turn this programme into a mobile app/web-based game. It is in an early stage of concept development. “This game is played on a mobile app and links in with the Cancer Smart school programme. This educational game is full of challenges to get as cancer smart as possible. It can be played as an individual, by class groups or as competitions between schools. “To develop a game like this will cost up to R1.5 million. “All our supporters create a fund-raiser idea to raise funds on our fund-raising platform: https://www.givengain.com/c/loveyournuts/. They can then ask people to donate and challenge others to join.” Meanwhile, to mark International Men’s Day recently, the provincial Health Department is offering a wide range of health services for men. Health MEC Nomafrench Mbombo said: “It is important for men to man up and take charge of their health by making wise, healthy decisions. A wise man knows his health status. Get tested for HIV/Aids, TB, blood pressure, and diabetes.” Cape Argus
