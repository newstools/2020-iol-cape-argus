Cape Town - Anti-gender-based violence organisations are partnering with universities to ensure students feel safer at campuses through services they will offer. UCT’s Office for Inclusivity & Change (OIC) has joined Rape Crisis to find ways to strengthen the support services to survivors of sexual offences. OIC director Sianne Alves said: “We wanted to ensure survivor support was providing a service that was authentic and professional. “In consultation with Rape Crisis, we worked collaboratively to invoke changes in the operations of the OIC and further capacitate the OIC with skills in counselling, trauma support and containment.” She said through revised services, survivors can benefit from a seamless debriefing and counselling support service from the moment of reporting through to the tribunal process or informal process. “If the case is proceeding externally, supportive networks with the police and the OIC have benefited survivors in taking up their cases in the criminal justice system,” she said. Ilitha Labantu has also recently partnered with UCT to address gender-based violence at the institution. Spokesperson Siya Monakali said: “We seek to engage students and management in very uncomfortable discussions around the issue of GBV and to encourage students and management to create an environment that is free of violence. “The issue of GBV should be properly addressed by ensuring that the institution is well capacitated, with services and structures in place to ensure the safety of its students, particularly young women.” He said universities were a microcosm of broader society, reflecting what took place in society. “We encourage universities to work in partnerships with organisations to help create and sustain a safe and conducive environment where all students are free and safe,” he said.
