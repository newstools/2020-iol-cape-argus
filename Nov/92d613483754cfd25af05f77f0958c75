As former vice president Joe Biden inches closer to winning the White House, President Donald Trump with his usual fighting spirit has made several false claims about voting fraud. And while it’s still too close to call, the wait of the results has been content gold for many on social media, but none more so than for those on TikTok. Here are just 5 examples of some of the hilarity on the social media platform. 1. Nevada making everyone wait All eyes now remain on swing states – Arizona, Georgia and Nevada – where the two presidential candidates go neck and neck with various counties expected to continue with vote counting well into Friday. However, everyone has been freaking out about Nevada as they have been taking their time to count votes and announce their result.

In what has been an nail-biting wait, Trump will certainly provide inspiration to many TikTokers.
