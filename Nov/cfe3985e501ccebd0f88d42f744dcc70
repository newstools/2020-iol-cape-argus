Cape Town - Police in Cape Town are investigating a shooting  which resulted in the death of five people and left two others wounded. In a statement on Tuesday, police spokeswoman Novela Potelwa said a team attached to the provincial detective branch was probing the shooting at the Nyanga terminus on Monday evening. The seven victims were sitting in a taxi on Sihlanu Avenue when gunmen approached the vehicle and fired multiple shots at 9.30pm, Potelwa said. “Four men between the ages of 30 and 36 died on the scene,” she said. “Three others were taken to a medical facility after sustaining serious injury. A fifth victim died in hospital. Two other victims who sustained injury remain in hospital.” While investigators were pursuing every lead, the motive for the incident was believed to be related to conflicts in the taxi industry, Potelwa added. “The investigators have opened murder and attempted murder cases,” she said. A police source told the African News Agency that the Nyanga shooting was related to another incident on Monday when six suspects shot and wounded six men and a woman in a wheelchair on the station deck in the Cape Town central business district just after midday. The station deck is the area where all minibus taxis from across the Cape metropole pick up thousands of passengers working in and around the city. A Cape Town traffic official arrested one suspect near the Castle of Good Hope and managed to recover a firearm. Five suspects remain at large. Potelwa said police had been deployed to potential hotspots in response to both shooting incidents. African News Agency (ANA)
