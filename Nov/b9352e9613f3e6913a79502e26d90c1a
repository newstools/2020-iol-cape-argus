Cape Town - As the Unemployment Insurance Fund begins opening and processing Covid-19 Temporary Employer-Employee Relief Scheme benefit applications on November 23, the Department of Labour has announced more than R52 billion has been disbursed in 11.5 million payments to more than 1 million employers since March. During his address to the nation last week, President Cyril Ramaphosa announced that the benefits would be extended by another month, to cover up to October 15. Claims can be lodged via the online portal https://uifecc.labour.gov.za/covid19// Acting UIF commissioner Marsha Bronkhorst said: “As with previous claim processes, to apply in the new period employers are required to upload similar documentation that includes a signed approval or acceptance letter, bank confirmation letter, proof of payment to employees, and refund to the UIF if applicable. UIF spokesperson Makhosonke Buthelezi said: “The extension has been subject to robust discussions with social partners at the National Economic Development and Labour Council. Receipt of Ters applications for 16 September to 15 October will close on 31 December, and no further applications be accepted beyond that. Acting Departmental Spokesperson Musa Zondi said: “This period covers employees whose employers are not permitted to commence operations under the disaster management regulations; those who are unable to make alternative arrangements for vulnerable workers, such as working from home or taking special measures under the OHS direction to protect them.” “It also covers those who are unable to make use of their services because of operational requirements caused by compliance with the regulations and directions such as rostering, staggering working hours, short time and the introduction of shift systems.” Cape Argus
