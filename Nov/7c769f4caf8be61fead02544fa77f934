Cape Town - Capetonians who awoke in the early hours of Tuesday morning by a minor earth tremor were quick to take to Twitter, and as a result came up with some comedic tweets. The tremor, measuring 3.4 on the Richter scale, occurred on  at 12.27am SAST. The Council of Geoscience (CGS) and the Western Cape government have since said there is no cause for panic and that the situation is being monitored. MEC of Local Government, Environmental Affairs and Development Planning in the Western Cape Anton Bredell said: ‚ÄúThe situation is being monitored closely and there are no imminent threats to public safety. "Following the event, some small aftershocks were felt in various Western Cape towns and Cape Town suburbs with no reports of damages to infrastructure or casualties, and no tsunami warning was issued.‚Äú The Twitterati, however, were on hand and documented their reactions to the seismic activity: Next thing Cape Town will be seeing table mountain on the streets because of this damn tremor pic.twitter.com/UY0G5AEEdE 2020 is clearly building up to the season finale, i felt that!!!!

It was only a 3.5 on the richter scale but you'll always be a 10. pic.twitter.com/sS4FWdyjS1 According to the CGS, this is the third recorded earthquake this year. It follows a 6.2-magnitude earthquake which occurred off the coast of southern Africa, 1 918km from Cape Town, on September 26. Thereafter a second tremor was felt just hours after the initial one, which registered a preliminary 2.3 on the local magnitude scale. Cape Argus
