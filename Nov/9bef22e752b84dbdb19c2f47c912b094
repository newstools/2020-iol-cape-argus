Cape Town - The Western Cape Education Department (WCED) said the disciplinary hearing against Heathfield High School principal Wesley Neumann has been scheduled for next week. This after the department met Neumann for a pre-hearing on Tuesday, with WCED spokesperson Bronagh Hammond saying she “cannot disclose the contents of an internal pre-hearing”. Hammond said the purpose was to establish facts that were common cause, narrow down the issues and address any points in limine. Neumann faced six charges after having refused to reopen the school amid the Covid-19 infection peak and writing an open letter to President Cyril Ramaphosa and the Cabinet asking for the closure of schools. Heathfield High Grade 12 learners were due to return to school in June. After failing to do so, Neumann was then scheduled to appear for a disciplinary hearing last month. He approached the Labour Court arguing that a decision regarding the legality of department head Brian Schreuder’s contract must be made first, and thus his disciplinary was postponed. The Labour Court ruled in favour of the WCED on November 2. Heathfield High executive action committee member Brandon de Kock said the WCED’s conduct confirmed the view that the charges brought against Neumann were both personally and politically motivated. “With the WCED acting in this crude manner, we seriously doubt that Neumann will have a free and fair hearing,” De Kock said. ANC provincial spokesperson on education, Khalid Sayed, said it was shocking that Neumann was summoned to a pre-hearing during school time amid the rigorous matric exam regulations and Grade 8-11 final exams.
