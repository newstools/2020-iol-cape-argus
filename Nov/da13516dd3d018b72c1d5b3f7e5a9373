Cape Town - The expected court appearance today of the founder and principal of a Cape Town hifth academy (school to memorise the Qur’an) charged with the sexual assault of minors has been postponed because of a positive Covid-19 case at Wynberg Magistrate’s Court. The Ottery-based Halāwat-ul-Qurān Haafith Academy founder, Abdul Karriem Davids, 45, from Surrey Estate, would have appeared on charges of sexual assault against minors. Police spokesperson FC van Wyk said that a sexual assault case was registered at the Grassy Park police station for investigation on November 6 – the incident occurred in May 2017. Van Wyk said the suspect was arrested on November 16, and appeared at the Wynberg Magistrate’s Court the following day. He was released on bail. “The suspect is out on another sexual assault case, registered at Grassy Park SAPS, and will appear on Friday. Both cases will be heard concurrently, where bail will be opposed,” said van Wyk before the postponement. Davids was first arrested in September last year for sexually assaulting a 13-year-old girl. The academy shared via its Facebook page last week that Davids has stepped down as principal, and that his wife would serve as its acting principal. Anti-sexual violence protesters are gearing up to protest at his next appearance. Protest organiser and rape survivor Faatin Bux said, “I consider myself a victor as opposed to a victim and I wanted to stand for anyone and everyone who has been affected by sexual violence.” Comedian and TV presenter Siv Ngesi, who lent his support to the protesters said, “I think there comes a point where silence becomes an accomplice and being quiet is a betrayal to women. I am sick and tired of being an accomplice and betraying women.” Davids’s lawyer, Leon van der Merwe, said his client would plead not guilty to all charges. Cape Argus
