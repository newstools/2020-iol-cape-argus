Cape Town - Belhar Ward councillor Delmaine Cottee with the community, held a tree-planting ceremony on Wednesday in honour of four youngsters from Groote Schuur Street who passed away in the last six months. Leerano Salomo, 23, and Leroy Lewis, 22, died in a car accident; while Eathon Hoffmeester, 27, their friend, was shot in the head in the same evening of June 7. Felicia Le Roux, 21, allegedly died in her sleep. Cottee said the planting of the trees won’t bring the young ones back but will help in healing the families. “I consulted the families on the best possible ways to celebrate and honour their lives and agreed on tree-planting. The community was shocked and disheartened at the passing of these young people,” he said. Cottee said some of the families were still traumatised, particularly the family of Hoffmeester who was shot in the head. Hoffmeester was on his way from an ATM in the area when the culprit allegedly followed him and shot him in the head more than twice. The alleged culprit, who Cottee said was still walking freely in the streets, is known to the community and the family. “The mother says she walks past the person on a daily basis and the sideway on which her son was killed. “The alleged person was arrested a couple of days after the incident but was released because there was allegedly no real evidence against him,” he said. Although the incident was not gang-related, Cottee said the problem in the area was that apparent gangsters wanted to draw the youngsters into gangs and when they do not adhere to the system, they become targets. Natasha Lewis, one of the victim’s mom, said honouring the youngsters will keep their memories alive. “I can’t explain how I feel about losing my only son… The trees would help in the healing process of the families, looking at them, nurturing and helping them grow is going to help a great deal and this will give purpose to the street and the community,” she said.
