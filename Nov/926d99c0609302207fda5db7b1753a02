Cape Town - In a city already struggling with burning shacks and wildfires, today's celebration of Guy Fawkes could stretch firefighting resources even further. The deadly annual celebration already started yesterday when a house and a vehicle were gutted in a fire in Mitchells Plain, allegedly caused by fireworks being discharged. The City’s Public Emergency Communication Centre said yesterday that it had fielded at least 18 calls since the start of the week, with complaints of illegal sales of fireworks or the illegal discharge of fireworks. The City has warned residents against discharging fireworks as Guy Fawkes Day has become synonymous with violence, damage to property and the displacing of animals. Working On Fire communications officer Limakatso Khalianyane urged residents to refrain from discharging fireworks as they could ignite veld fires. “Working On Fire discourages anything that has the potential of causing runaway fires, especially now that we are in season. However, in cases where our services are needed we are ready to respond in full force to save lives and protect the environment. Our teams throughout the province will be on high alert today, as they have been throughout this week while the Fire Danger Index was high,” said Khalianyane. Animal Rescue Organisation (ARO) head of fundraising and communications Teagan Schwerin said their mobile clinics would be in the communities, ready to provide medical treatment to animals. “Our animal welfare assistants will bring any injured and abused animals to the ARO Hospital if care or treatment is required. Our front clinic will also be open to provide any necessary treatment to victims of Guy Fawkes or other medical conditions,” she said. Mayoral member for safety and security JP Smith said no fireworks would be allowed unless a permit had been obtained to host a display. Cape Argus
