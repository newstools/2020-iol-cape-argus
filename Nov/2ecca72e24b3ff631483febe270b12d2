Cape Town - The Cape Town Central City Improvement District  (CCID) is celebrating its 20th anniversary – and its 20th clean audit. CCID chairperson Rob Kane said: “The four pillars of our CCID mandate have remained unchanged over many years, namely safety and security, urban management, social development and communication. "However, the CCID has retained its relevance to its community by constantly evolving and adapting to circumstances on the ground.” The organisation had stood the test of time thanks to the principles that underpinned its operation, namely resilience, stability, a clear focus, decisive management and leadership. Kane said the CCID’s task – to provide top-up services in addition to those provided by its primary partners to ensure the CBD of Cape Town was safe, clean, caring and open for business – had remained unchanged. In collaboration with its partners, the CCID had aimed to stabilise Cape Town Central, and transform it from a “crime-and-grime” scenario to a haven for investors. CCID chief executive Tasso Evangelinos said: “Our hard work and dedication over two decades have paid off.” He said he and his team remained humbled “to have been entrusted with this work". "It has been the most challenging of years. Maintaining this success this year … has placed huge demands on our organisation but we rose to the challenge from the get-go and were prepared to face the ultimate test, swiftly adapting our operational strategies and continuing to deliver on our mandate of keeping the city centre safe, clean, caring – especially during the lockdown levels when it was not open for business.” Cape Argus
