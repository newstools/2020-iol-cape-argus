Cape Town - A legal tussle between the EFF and the City could be looming after Mayor Dan Plato threatened court action to make sure the EFF pays for the damages to municipal property in Brackenfell last week. Plato said the EFF made it clear that it had no regard for the rule of law and the City manager had indicated they were assessing the cost of the damage to city infrastructure. “Once a full assessment has been done, the City will be recovering these costs from the EFF. I want to assure the public that we will not tolerate lawlessness in this City and the EFF will be held accountable for the damage caused.” The EFF descended on Brackenfell to protest against alleged racism at Brackenfell High School. A permit was granted for the party to protest outside the school today, giving permission for 100 protesters to hand over a memorandum. The EFF’s provincial chairperson, Melikhaya Xegos, said: “We are aware the DA-controlled City of Cape Town wants to push the entire thing to the EFF. We are in consultation with our lawyers so that they can advise us on the matter. But we are not shaken.” Damages incurred include a fire engine that was torched, traffic lights and roads that were damaged, a field that was set alight. A car dealership’s windows were smashed, private vehicles attacked and several shops looted, according to reports. Cape Argus
