Cape Town - Tributes are pouring in for cyclist Nathier Roberts, 38, who died after he was knocked down by an alleged drunken driver during a bike ride on the R27 West Coast road near Atlantis yesterday. Transport and Public Works spokesperson Jandré Bakker said a vehicle allegedly drove with excessive speed from Atlantis towards a T-junction and could not apply brakes in time and drove into a group of cyclists. Bakker said one died while another cyclist was transported to a Netcare hospital. “The department of transport and public works pleads with road users not to drink and drive.” Police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana said cases of culpable homicide and drunken driving have been opened for investigation after traffic officials attended to an accident on West Coast road yesterday morning. Rwexana said he was told that a vehicle collided with the two cyclists. “A 38-year-old man died due to his injuries and a 55-year-old was transported to a nearby medical facility. “The driver of the vehicle, aged 28, was arrested for drunken driving and culpable homicide. He will appear in the Atlantis Magistrate's Court once charged,” she said. Velokhaya Life Cycling Academy general manager Sipho Mona said they were saddened to hear of the passing of Roberts, and have extended their condolences to his family, friends and teammates at the Cape Town Giants Cycling Club. “As cyclists we are all aware of how reckless drivers can be and their aggression and impatience toward those of us on two wheels … please be patient when overtaking cyclists and vigilant of all fellow road users,” Mona said.
