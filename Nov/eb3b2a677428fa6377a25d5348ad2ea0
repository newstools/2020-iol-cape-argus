JOHANNESBURG - As promised there’s a new entry-level Toyota in town, and it hails from Indonesia. The new Toyota Agya is priced from R178 600 and there is only one basic spec grade - which is generously equipped. However, specifying an audio system will push the price up to R182 400, while an automatic gearbox variant will set you back R192 500, or R196 300 with audio. It’s interesting to note that the new Agya is not a great deal cheaper than the recently introduced Starlet, despite being significantly smaller - with the Agya measuring 3660mm in length, versus the Starlet’s 3995mm. The Agya is also slightly bigger than the Aygo that it replaces and it has a much bigger boot - 260 litres versus 168. All Agya derivatives ship with 14-inch alloy wheels as well as air conditioning, electric windows, remote central locking, multi-information display, dual front airbags, seatbelt pre-tensioners (front) and ABS brakes. As for its crash structure, the pre-facelift version of this car achieved a four-star for both adult and child protection in the Asean Ncap tests. The Agya is sold with a two-service, 20 000km service plan as well as the usual three-year/100 000km warranty. Power comes from a 1-litre, three-cylinder normally aspirated petrol engine that produces 49kW and 89Nm. This can be paired with either a five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission. Buyers can choose from a range of funky exterior colours, including Sunrise Orange, Electric Yellow and Flame red, as well as more conservative hues such as white, grey and silver.
