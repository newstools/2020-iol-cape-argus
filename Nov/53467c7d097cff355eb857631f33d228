by Stuart Pringle The DA’s policy conference earlier this year and its Federal Congress this past weekend has put clear blue water between South Africa’s official opposition and other parties by re-committing to the principle of non-racism; viable alternative policies to rid SA of the legacy of our divided past and a strong, committed leadership to take the party forward. As newly elected DA leader John Steenhuisen has said: “The DA is a liberal party; committed to non-racialism; a market economy and a capable state.” And yet for many in the media and some analysts the DA was wrong to re-commit itself to the constitutionally enshrined principle of non-racism and to elect the leader most favoured by the members who were delegates to the congress. According to them, parties should elect leaders based on what they look like; and transformation means becoming just like the ANC, with a little less corruption and chair-throwing. Most people probably define setting one’s sails to what one perceives the political winds to be as opportunism. For many in the media and some analysts, such opportunism, based on their view that South Africans are as obsessed with race as they are, is viewed as a winning formula. But for those of us who believe that South Africans need real change and real hope, based on our experiences on the ground across the length and breadth of South Africa, opportunism is not the answer. There is no evidence which suggests that for the majority of South Africans who aren’t among the elite race is an issue which weighs heaviest on their minds when their immediate needs for employment, food and shelter are barely being met as a consequence of 26 years of failed policies that have only brought a better life to the ANC elite. The DA has spent the past year undergoing extensive consultation on the course it needs to chart. It is clear people want a genuine commitment to real change and hope to help lift them out of the circumstances they find themselves in, and have neither the time nor the inclination to get involved in reductionist, race-based debates. 📺|🇿🇦"We are a liberal party committed to non-racialism, a market economy, and a capable state that empowers citizens and cares for the vulnerable.We have always been at our strongest – and achieved our best results – when we stood strong on these principles." - @jsteenhuisen pic.twitter.com/cF8TM87MHJ * Stuart Pringle, Somerset West. ** The views expressed here are not necessarily those of Independent Media.
