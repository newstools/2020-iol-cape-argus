Cape Town - The names of two candidates have been recommended to Community Safety MEC Albert Fritz to urgently fill vacancies on the Western Cape Liquor Authority’s (WCLA) governing board. This was because the board has been struggling since two members resigned in June, said Reagan Allen, chairperson of the standing committee on community safety. There were originally 19 applicants for the posts, but the committee ended up interviewing 17 after two of the candidates withdrew their nominations and declined interviews. The interviews were conducted via a virtual and/or telephonic platform. Committee chairperson Reagan Allen said: “I have written to MEC Fritz and informed him that the committee has resolved to submit the names of its preferred candidates for the two vacancies, Dr Luzuko Mdunyelwa and Andreas le Roux for the vacant positions on the board.” The two members who resigned in June were chairperson Thembalihle Sidaki and member Underé Deglon. “Furthermore, the committee also encouraged the department to invite the remainder of the candidates to apply for membership for the next term of the governing board.” The interviews and subsequent recommendations come within a month of acting head of the department of community safety Yashina Pillay advising the standing committee that the board's heavy workload necessitated the urgent replacement of the two members. The Department of Community Safety's chief director for security risk management, Simion George, said: “The regulations setting up the board say it must have six members who have appropriate knowledge of or experience in systems and processes for ensuring proper accountability, probity and openness in the conduct of the business of an organisation. "It must also have one member, at the very least, who has appropriate knowledge of or experience in dealing with the combating of the negative social consequences of the abuse of liquor,” said George.
