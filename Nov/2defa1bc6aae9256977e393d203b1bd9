Cape Town - The total capacity of dams supplying the Cape Town Metro decreased by 0.5% between November 17 and November 22 from 99.3% the previous week to 98.8%, according to the City’s Mayco member for water and waste Xanthea Limberg. Releasing the weekly dam level report Limberg said: “Daily water consumption for the same period increased by 42 million litres per day to 756 million litres per day. At the same time last year, dam levels were at 83.2%.” “Residents are reminded that while water restrictions were lifted from November 1, permanent regulations in the City’s water by-laws governing water use still apply,” said Limberg. Among the restrictions include regulations on the use of outdoor water use and groundwater with watering with municipal drinking water, only allowed before 9am or after 6pm,to avoid evaporation losses in the heat of the day. Meanwhile the latest average level for dams across the Western Cape is 79.4%. Last year at the same time it was only 65.2%. Local Government MEC Anton Bredell said: “The situation is optimistic compared to previous years.” “We are heading into the summer season where temperatures and water demand will spike. We want to urge consumers to continue to use water wisely,” said Bredell. With regards to the fire season, Bredell said: “The months ahead are high risk months with regards to wildfires and the province is calling on the public to use great caution when it comes to making outdoor fires.” “Should a fire get out of control, please let the authorities know as soon as possible. The easiest number to remember in this regard is 112,” said Bredell. Cape Argus
