Cape Town - The Grassy Park Community Policing Forum has called for tighter controls related to medication, especially those that could be used to make drugs. This comes after police raided a residence in the area and confiscated illicit drugs and medicinal products valued at R50 000. Police spokesperson André Traut said that on Friday night police conducted a search operation at a residence in Perth Road and arrested a 39-year-old man for the illegal possession of schedule 5 medicine and dagga. Traut said the drugs were concealed in the bathroom ceiling. The suspect is expected to appear in court in Wynberg today. CPF chairperson Melvin Jonkers said drugs had been found on the premises before. “Of prime concern to the CPF is that the illegal dispensing of medicines which could be used to make drugs continues unabated in our precinct. This is evident from the many used bottles of medicines containing codeine seen lying around in the neighbourhoods. "It is our considered opinion that these medicines should be prescribed. They are too easy to obtain. There should be tighter controls over medication. "How is it possible for any individual to have such large stocks of these medicines?” he said. Jonkers called on the police to ensure that the alleged distributor be charged appropriately and that the National Prosecuting Authority press for a severe punishment. Meanwhile, a 25-year-old woman has been arrested for drug dealing in Wolseley after 2 100 mandrax tablets, 1.7kg of crystal meth (tik), four bags containing cash (in notes and coins) and a bag with foreign currency notes was found. In a separate incident, four SANDF members were arrested in Atlantis for dealing in drugs after dagga worth R50 000 was discovered in the boot of a SANDF vehicle. The suspects, aged between 30 and 51, are expected to appear in court today. Cape Argus
