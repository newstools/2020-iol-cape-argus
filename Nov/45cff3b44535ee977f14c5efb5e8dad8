by Rob Johnston Thank you, Brian Isaacs, for your article (Racism seems to be endemic in former Model C and private schools – Cape Argus, November 19); I totally agree, and am heartened by your (previously printed) agreement with Jonathan Jansen: – great minds, etc. But your question about why there is still racism in government schools may require that we try to see it from the point of view of the youngsters themselves. Firstly, mainstream media and social media, hype up anything that can remotely be considered racism – so there is an unnatural focus on the subject. Secondly, there seems to be an imbalance in the reporting, such that the EFF is not condemned for their racial statements, and there are several black business groupings which are unashamedly exclusionary, and not excoriated by the press. Youngsters are extremely sensitive to unfairness, so the above imbalance will not have escaped their notice. Thirdly, the future career for a white Brackenfell learner looks bleak, as BEE and Employment Equity discriminate against them on the basis of skin colour, even though they weren't born until well after the dark days of apartheid. Anybody who suffers unfair discrimination is likely to develop a skewed view of life, and may well only feel valued amongst their peers. Not a correct approach, but understandable. Hopefully, educators (and the press?) can come up with a way of addressing the real and perceived unfairness that entrench an “Us and Them” response to school life. * Rob Johnston, Tokai. ** The views expressed here are not necessarily those of Independent Media.
