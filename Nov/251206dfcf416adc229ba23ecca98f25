Cape Town - With the 16-days of activism against gender-based violence starting on Wednesday, a group of concerned people protested outside the Wynberg Magistrate’s Court, where a 26-year-old suspect appeared in connection with the rape of a 24 year-old Crossroads woman. Anam Tsholoba and an accomplice were arrested last Thursday after horrifying footage of the victim’s ordeal sparked demonstrations in the community last week. However, only Tsholoba appeared in the court yesterday. The victim’s friend, who did not want to be named, said she was also a rape victim, and she knew how painful it was to continuously see the perpetrator roaming around the streets, after he was released on bail. She and community members protested outside the court, calling for justice to be tightened, saying that when survivors file a complaint for sexual assault, the prosecution is very rare and takes years to complete, and the conviction rate in trials that do go to court is very low. The case comes in-light of the country gearing up for 16 Days of Activism against gender-based violence (GBV), with the Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC) on Gender-Based Violence and Femicide (GBVF) to launch 16 Days of Activism for No Violence Against Women and Children Campaign on Wednesday. Media liaison in the Ministry in the presidency for women, youth and persons with disabilities Mmabatho Ramompi said the 16 Days Campaign is a UN campaign which takes place annually from November 25 (International Day of No Violence against Women) to December 10 (International Human Rights Day), and the launch takes place during Disability Rights Awareness Month.
