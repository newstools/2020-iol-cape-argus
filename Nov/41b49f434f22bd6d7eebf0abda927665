Cape Town - Commuters on Metrorail’s northern line can now look forward to resuming their daily commute into town as train services to and from Malmesbury will be running once again. The daily weekday service will run between Cape Town and Malmesbury starting today. Spokesperson for Metrorail Riana Scott said: “With strict Covid-19 regulations observed, the Malmesbury service will be running once again. We have taken great care to ensure that the service will be in compliance with the Covid-19 travel safety regulations. We have placed aboard our coaches safety marshals and security personnel to ensure that commuters adhere to safety regulations.” Fisantekraal resident Nokhukhanya Mabika said: “Finally we can use the train again. I’m really glad because this way we won't spend so much money. I just hope that it won't be full and that everyone will act responsibly.” According to the Metrorail timetable the train will depart weekdays from Malmesbury station at 5.25am and arrive at Cape Town station at 7.40am. The service will operate via Monte Vista, Bellville and Kraaifontein, and stop at Fisantekraal, Melish, Mikpunt, Klipheuwel, Wintervogel, Kalbaskraal and Abbotsdale stations. “We have made provisions for our customers to purchase tickets on board the train. We would also like to encourage commuters, in line with current Covid-19 regulations, to work with us and help curb the spread of the virus. “Commuters are also advised to arrive at least 20 minutes earlier to the time of departure to allow for sanitising, and to have the correct fare amount handy to minimise handling of cash, not forgetting to wear a mask. A strict policy of no mask, no travel applies,” said Scott. Metrorail Acting regional manager Raymond Maseko said: “As this service is the only mass public transport mode linking Malmesbury to Cape Town currently, it was crucial to resume the service as soon as possible.” Cape Argus
