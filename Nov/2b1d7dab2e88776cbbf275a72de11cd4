Craving an escape from the hustle and bustle of life? Well, South African National Parks (SANParks) is the latest tourism establishment offering a Black Friday deal. SANParks is offering a 40% discount for new reservations made via the online booking platform on Black Friday, November 27, 2020. Black Friday is an informal name for the day following Thanksgiving Day in the United States, which has been regarded as the beginning of the Christmas shopping season. Most major retailers and organisations that sell products or services offer promotional sales on Black Friday, at vastly discounted prices. According to Acting Head of Communications, Reynold Thakhuli, “SANParks is excited to offer a discount on online bookings for accommodation, camping, trails and activities within our stable. “The discount will apply to all online bookings made for accommodation, camping, trails and activities, for stays from  January 27 to  March 18 2021, including weekends.” Thakhuli said online booking for game drives and walks is limited to specific camps in Kruger National Park. "Trails that can be booked online are the Otter Trail in Garden Route National Park and Kruger’s 4x4 Trails, Backpack Trails and Wilderness Trails.” The discount applies only to the cost of accommodation, camping, trails and/or activities. Thakhuli said no discounts will be offered on conservation fees, Wild Card purchases, activities (not available on the SANParks online bookings platform), meals, etc. A 1% Community Levy will apply to discounted reservation costs. The 40% discount offer is not available for Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park.
