This is my humble call to all scattered, hungered, bewildered athletes, from whom justice has been withheld, who have become the victims of the racist and discriminatory World Athletics body which, in its concupiscence for wealth and power have forgotten what it had been elected to be: representatives of all the people. Today I stand with Caster Semenya against these racist and discriminatory regulations introduced by World Athletics, that subject her to take medication that limits her testosterone levels to be able to return to the track legally. These barbaric new regulations infringe athlete’s human rights, including the right to dignity and the right to bodily integrity. I remain inspired by Semenya’s indomitable spirit and will remain steadfast in our stand against racism and discrimination, until she is allowed to run free from persecution. I remain hopeful that World Athletics will see the error it has made and reverse the prohibitive rules which restricts Caster and many other athletes from competing. * Thulani Dasa, Khayelitsha. ** The views expressed here are not necessarily those of Independent Media.
