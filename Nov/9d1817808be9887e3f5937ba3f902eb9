The Support Stellenbosch campaign is rewarding guests for visiting the town by inviting visitors to play, and stay, with a range of incredible overnight stays and exciting tourism experiences at discounted rates. The initiative is endorsed by the Stellenbosch Municipality, Stellenbosch University, Cape Winelands District municipality, and Wesgro and calls on residents to support local business, experience Stellenbosch as tourists, and inspire their networks to discover what Stellenbosch has to offer. “Participating accommodation has been discounted at 50% and can be enjoyed by visitors separately, but also in conjunction with holiday packages offered during the promotion period. In addition, visitors can enjoy discounts on a range of experiences such as pairings, guided wine tours, spa treatments and e-bike rides, among others,” says  Jeanneret Momberg, CEO of Visit Stellenbosch. Stellenbosch has also cleverly linked reward with readiness to ensure that residents and visitors are comfortable and safe during their stay. “It’s very logical that we cannot invite people to Stellenbosch unless we can assure that we are a safe and responsible destinations so the linkage between the two is very close. This campaign was also a way to get businesses that had yet to implement their protocols to get ‘Stellenbosch Ready’ because only establishments that have pledged to implement our stringent WTTC-endorsed health and hygiene safety protocols are allowed to participate in the Support Stellenbosch campaign,” concludes Momberg. This week, Visit Stellenbosch also unveiled a new brand identity reflecting the youthful and innovative spirit of the destination – the warm heart of the Winelands. The new brand is the final step in a journey which began just over a year ago to unify all Stellenbosch tourism stakeholders under one umbrella to grow the town’s tourism and experience economy for the benefit of all communities. Visit Stellenbosch was created to centralise the operational functions and resources of Stellenbosch stakeholders in tourism, business, food, and wine, among other sectors. “Stellenbosch is a destination brand that is approachable and a tad decadent, but there’s nothing we love more than sharing our lovely town and its treasures with others,” adds Momberg.
