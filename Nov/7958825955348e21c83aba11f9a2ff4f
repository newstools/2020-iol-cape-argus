Cape Town - A report from the auditor-general giving 21 out of 22 provincial departments and entities an “unqualified” audit outcome on their annual financial statements has been dismissed as “deceptive” by the provincial opposition. Finance and Economic Opportunities MEC David Maynier said: “Of the 10 Western Cape government public entities, seven received an unqualified opinion with no findings, or clean audit, three received an unqualified opinion with findings, and none received a qualified opinion with findings in the 2019/20 financial year. “The Department of Agriculture remains qualified as a result of a long-standing matter of a technical nature. After a Western Cape High court exonerated the department, we now await the matter to be finally determined by the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA).” EFF provincial spokesperson on finance and economic opportunities Nosipho Makamba-Botya said: “We will not be deceived by these clean- audit outcomes because their scope is somewhat limited when it comes to detecting deep-rooted corruption… “With regards to the provincial Department of Agriculture receiving a qualified outcome, we just hope that the matter will be decided speedily by the SCA…” ANC provincial spokesperson for Finance Nomi Nkondlo said: “The paper compliance is worrying if conditions, especially of the poorest citizens, are a far cry of what’s on paper. “The truth is if both the financial and service delivery were used as the basis of audit outcomes, we would be dealing with the complete reality. “If the Department of Community Safety has a clean audit, does it mean the Western Cape is a safe province? That our communities are the safest? The brutal shooting of seven people in Gugulethu on Monday night is testimony to the stark difference between what is on paper and the lived experiences of citizens.” Cape Argus
