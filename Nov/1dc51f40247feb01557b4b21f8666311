Cape Town - Kensington Home for the Aged is appealing for assistance after their trusted vehicle, used to transport senior residents for hospital visits and other trips for the past 18 years is about to pack up. The Home now faces a serious challenge as the vehicle is used daily to transport its 100 senior residents. Home Manager Leon Courie said for the past few months, the vehicle had stalled while transporting residents, resulting in them arriving late for appointments, having to have them rescheduled, or unable to attend. Courie said: “We’ve had it for about 18 years, and it was used on a daily basis to transport residents to the Day Hospital and Groote Schuur, New Somerset, and Tygerberg Hospitals.” He said the need for another vehicle was extremely urgent. “The vehicle is back on the road, but we are hoping it will survive until a good Samaritan comes along.” Sizzled Summer Music & Food Fest with event ticket seller, Quicket, have set up a fundraising page with a target of R800000 to assist the home with the purchase of a new vehicle, including a wheelchair lift. Courie said any amount to see the Home obtain a reliable vehicle would be welcomed. Una de Lillie, who resides in the same street as the Home, has been trying to assist in raising th funds. “It would be appreciated if the community at large can play some role through their generosity in ensuring that essential services are rendered to our vulnerable residents.” To donate, visit Kensington Home for the Aged fundraiser on Quicket or contact Una de Lillie on 0826627655 or Courie 0215932274/85.
