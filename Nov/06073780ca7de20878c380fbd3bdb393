Cape Town -  Liberty Promenade mall has created an edutaining new music video using catchy lyrics and dance moves with the aim of encouraging children to continue to protect themselves and others from the risks of Covid-19. The official #BeWiseSanitise video features four talented young artists from Yellowwood Primary; Leshane-Moore Baartman, Jordan Cruz Adams, Sherl Sauls, and Llewellyn Junior Lambrechts. Each were selected as a result of their performances at Liberty Promenade’s Next Generation musical event in 2019. The mall conceptualised the campaign, put together the lyrics and dance moves of the song, and the learners practiced it for a few weeks under the supervision of their music teacher, Sauls. Llewellyn recorded the anthem in a studio in Woodstock. Jordan Adams, Grade 7 pupil featured in the video said: “I am proud of being in the video. It is an important reminder for kids to protect them from Covid-19.” General Manager of Liberty Promenade Brenda Bibby said: “These kids were eager, energetic and passionate and together they made the perfect group and executed Liberty Promenade’s #BeWiseSanitise video wonderfully, and with so much swag! We can’t wait to see all the other amazing Cape Town kids perform their #BeWiseSanitise routine.” To further encourage kids to be Covid-wise, Liberty Promenade calls on all Cape Town kids aged between 4 and 18 to submit a video of themselves singing and dancing along to the mall’s original #BeWiseSanitise video which is available on Liberty Promenade’s social media pages and website. Ten R1 000 Liberty Promenade gift cards will be awarded to the most innovative entries. Details on how to enter:
