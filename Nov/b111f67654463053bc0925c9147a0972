Cape Town - The launch of South African National Parks (SANParks) Week took place yesterday at the West Coast National Park. South Africans with valid IDs will be able to visit all parks from today until Friday. It is hoped that through this initiative, marginalised communities will feel more accepted. Environment, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Barbara Creecy said: “South African National Parks Week was started in 2006 as a way of making our national parks more accessible to communities across the country, many of whom had never had an opportunity to visit before.” She said the theme this year was “Know your national parks”, and it was hoped that the initiative would allow more South Africans to develop a sense of pride and ownership of the iconic areas that were not only rich in wildlife but also contributed significantly to the economy. SANParks chief executive Fundisile Mketeni said: “Through these initiatives we want to make our small contribution towards addressing past imbalances. Over five years ago, the board of the South African National Parks revised its vision to a new vision of a sustainable National Parks system connecting society. Key to that vision is the awareness that our National Parks cannot exist without the people of this country.” He said to ensure access to all South Africans, some of the national parks would extend free access until the weekend. SANParks will support the Table Mountain Aerial Cableway Company clean-up tomorrow. The public is invited to join in. The clean-up will take place from 8am until 1pm and will start at Platteklip Gorge hiking trail. Visit https://www.sanparks.org/about/events/parks_week Cape Argus
