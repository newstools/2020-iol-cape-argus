While many have been binge watching the fourth season of “The Crown”, many viewers have been in awe of Gillian Anderson’s portrayal of former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher. Specifically the scene where Thatcher meets Queen Elizabeth, played by Olivia Colman, for the first time. In the scene, the two powerful women exchange pleasantries and throw some light shade back and forth. TikToker Lisa Beasley seems have taken to Anderson’s take on Thatcher and done her own impression of the former prime minister. Beasley posted several videos of her impression of Thatcher following the new season of “The Crown“ dropping.

In the TikTok, Beasley greets the “queen“ with an hilariously long curtsey and then the camera flips to show she’s talking to a Vogue Magazine with the Queen Bey the cover. She follows this up by saying that Beyoncé’s subjects are unsure whether her athleisure wear, refer to her Ivy Park collection, is for working out or going out. ##MargaretThatcher discusses a delicate matter with the ##Queen In “The Crown” season four,  Queen Elizabeth and her family find themselves preoccupied with safeguarding the line of succession by securing an appropriate bride for Prince Charles (Josh O’Connor), who is still unmarried at 30. As the nation begins to feel the impact of divisive policies introduced by Thatcher, tensions arise between her and the queen which only grow worse as Thatcher leads the country into the Falklands War, generating conflict within the Commonwealth. While Charles’ romance with a young Lady Diana Spencer (Emma Corrin) provides a much-needed fairytale to unite the British people, behind closed doors, the royal family is becoming increasingly divided.
