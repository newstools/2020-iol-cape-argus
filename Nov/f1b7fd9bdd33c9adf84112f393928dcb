Cape Town - A 59-year-old rower is preparing for his solo departure across the Atlantic Ocean and will be dependent only on renewable energy for the entire three months. Zirk Botha is expected to depart on December 1 from Cape Town en route to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. He will be the first person to attempt the transatlantic crossing by himself. Botha has dedicated his journey to the fight against fossil fuels and their impact on the environment. “I want to use the challenge to put a spotlight on the impact of fossil fuels and irresponsible consumerism on the planet which will be the future home of our children and future generations.” He said that being 100% self-sustaining for more than three months will perfectly showcase how renewable energy is the solution. “I will be totally reliant on solar panels and solar-charged batteries as the source of electricity for my water maker (desalinator), auto-pilot, safety equipment, radio and satellite communications equipment,” he said. Botha will be sponsored by Juwi Renewable Energies. The crossing will require him to row unassisted for about 100 days, over about 7 000km, with the likelihood of treacherous weather conditions. “I will have no supporting safety boat and can expect to experience large waves and swells, not to mention the threat of numerous tanker and other large vessels bearing down on me as I move through the shipping lanes.” Ten litres of water and 8 000 calories of food is to be consumed per day while on the journey and Botha still expects to lose more than 12kg in weight. Juwi SA managing director Greg Austin said: “I deeply admire Zirk for taking a journey in the name  of sustainability and climate change… If this trip inspires others to act, then I believe Zirk’s mission would have been accomplished.” Cape Argus
