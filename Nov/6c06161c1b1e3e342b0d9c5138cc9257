Steenberg Hotel & Spa is offering free accommodation for children under 12. The 5-star boutique hotel, situated on a farm in the heart of the Constantia Wine Valley, is offering exciting activities to keep the children enthralled while the parents take in the views of the Steenberg Vineyards and the surrounding areas. Families can also explore the Cape Peninsula. The luxury hotel offers two and three-bedroom villas, private outdoor spaces, a rejuvenating spa, two top-notch restaurants, world-class wines, a championship golf course, relaxing garden and vineyard walks. Bikes and trikes are on hand allowing the whole family to take in the outstretched vistas by embarking on walking or cycling trails. Guests can also enjoy fun-filled lawn games, pool action, kiddies’ menus to satisfy even the fussiest of eaters, and for the ultimate spoil, mini-spa treatments. There are also 17 original sculptures by abstract artist Edoardo Villa, with a feast of contemporary art on the doorstep at the Norval Foundation sculpture garden. Other nearby activities ideal for family outings include plate decorating at the Clay Café, Acrobranching, The Bike Park and a penguin encounter on Boulder’s Beach. Family meals may be enjoyed in the comfort of your room, your own private dining area o picnics under grand old oak trees. Meals with or without the children can be enjoyed at Steenberg’s beloved cellar door eatery, Bistro Sixteen82, or the stylish signature restaurant, Tryn, where you can delight in Executive Chef Kerry Kilpin’s trademark culinary treasures and famous twists to some cherished classics.
