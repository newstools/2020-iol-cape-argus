Cape Town - The City says an investigation has been launched after a MyCiTi bus was engulfed in flames at the Civic Centre in Cape Town CBD at the weekend. City Fire and Rescue Service spokesperson Edward Bosch said the fire crews responded to reports of a burning bus at the MyCiTi Civic Centre station at around 7am on Saturday. Upon arrival the bus was well alight. Bosch said no injuries were reported and the flames were extinguished within 30 minutes. The bus was extensively damaged. A thick cloud of black smoke could be seen over the Civic Centre and some part of the station where the bus was standing was also damaged. City transport portfolio committee chairperson Angus McKenzie said a full investigation into why the MyCiTi bus caught alight would immediately take place. Transport mayco member Felicity Purchase said the portion of the station that was damaged had been isolated and “we are boarding and disembarking from another platform”. McKenzie said at this stage it looked like there was an electrical fault in the bus. This would be investigated. Anyone with information that could assist in the investigation is urged to contact the Crime Stop number 0860010111 or via the MySAPSApp. Cape Argus
