Cape Town – The Thembokwezi Residents Association has started a petition to have the City scrap water management devices (WMDs) and estimated bills in the Khayelitsha area. The association said it would be against the installation of the devices or any changes made to water meters in the area until the City held a public participation process outlining what its “indigent” policy entailed. “Since 2011 the City has not been calculating meter readings but has  been estimating (usage), which has resulted in people having ridiculous amounts (bills)," association spokesperson Phindile George said. "They are also running from providing a public participation platform so that the community can engage on issues of  incorrect billing and the water management devices." George said this had resulted in a situation where the City used contracted agents, who intimidated residents by forcefully installing the devices, and also illegally entering properties while residents were not at home to install the devices, which he said were not  approved by the SA Bureau of Standards. “Our take is that these WMDs only provide 350ml of water, which was never designed for our community set-up," he said. George said the City should scrap bills which were inaccurately estimated and implement a flat rate that would be agreed on by everyone. City spokesperson Luthando Tyhalibongo said some sections of the Thembokwezi community had been preventing the City from taking meter readings and from determining whether water was being abused. “Previously, these residents demanded that WMDs be replaced with 'free-flow' meters, and all debt be written off before they would allow water readings to resume,” he said.
