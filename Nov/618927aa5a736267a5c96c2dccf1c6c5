Cape Town - A proposal has been made for a youth parliament to be set up for the Western Cape, at which young people could make inputs on issues such as climate change, education and social conflict. The proposal was made by Good MPL Brett Herron during a virtual youth dialogue on parliamentary democracy during and post Covid-19, held in the legislature and hosted by legislature speaker Masizole Mnqasela. Most of the young participants were nominated to take part in the dialogue by district municipalities, and took part in it from the municipalities via a virtual platform, while some from Cape Town metro attended the proceedings in person at the legislature, adhering to Covid-19 regulations. Herron said: “I propose that we establish a youth parliament for the Western Cape whose deliberations should be heard and considered by our standing committees and the legislature. Our society is beset with significant challenges that will have a direct impact on future generations. "Young people should be able to influence how we respond to these challenges. Not just at a dialogue or on Youth Day, but in a structured, inclusive and formally recognised way.” Mnqasela assured delegates that their inputs would be forwarded to members of the legislature. The topic, "The impact of Covid-19   on the work of the legislature, and why the role that Parliament plays – oversight and accountability – needs to continue even during a national state of disaster", was introduced for discussion at the dialogue by MPL members Khalid Sayed (ANC) and Gillion Bosman (DA).
