Cape Town â€“ Thousands of EFF protesters are on the scene and have began their Kraaifontein Community March on Friday morning to hand over memorandums of demand. There is heavy police presence in the community who will usher the group to their three pit stops where they will hand in memorandums of demand. The Kraaifontein Community March is led by the EFF Cape Metro Region, where the party will march to the municipal offices, police station and day hospital. The party is marching to the municipal offices to protest poor service delivery, and evictions. Then they will move on to the police station, where they are protesting against crime, gender-based violence and protection fees. Their memorandum to the police incudes the demand that they want to be allowed to be assisted in their home languages at the local police station. The EFF is also demanding that station commander Brigadier Gerda Van Niekerk to be dismissed. The memorandum was handed to Kraaifontein SAPS by Cape Metro regional chairperson Unathi Ntame. Lastly, the group will move to the day hospital to voice its discontent against the alleged discriminatory processing systems faced by HIV/Aids patients and the poor health-care services. Before the march began leaders of the organisations collected and asked participants to hand in the weapons and sticks they were carrying. Earlier in the morning a helicopter could be seen scoping the area. They are also demanding that the City allow them to stay in their informal settlement as they have nowhere else to go. Cape Argus
