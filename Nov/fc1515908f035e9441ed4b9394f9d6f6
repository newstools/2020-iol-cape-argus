Cape Town - A Kraaifontein resident is beaming with pride after his team’s Xitsonga Dictionary App came in tops as the 2020 Fundi Best Educational App at the annual MTN Business App of the Year Awards, which took place virtually. Founder, 29-year-old Mukondleteri Dumela, whose app not only works to teach the unique Xitsonga language, but was created to instil a sense of pride within the Vatsonga community, said he was excited and grateful for the recognition of his and his team’s work. “It’s overwhelming to receive an award of this magnitude. The fact that our hard work on digitising Xitsonga has been recognised and is being celebrated has instilled confidence in our team to continue our work,” Dumela said. He said the idea to create the app was an extension of his initial idea, a Xitsonga website. The app took four months to build, with many of the initial features already available on the xitsonga.org website. It offers unique and notable features, including the options to access Xitsonga proverbs and idioms, as well as the wisdom of the Vatsonga people. It also allows users to simply take a picture using the Xitsonga vision feature to find out what the word is in Xitsonga. The team plans to add more languages to the app. Cape Argus
