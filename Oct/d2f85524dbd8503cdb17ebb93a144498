The following letter is in response to, “WATCH: Queer activists occupy lavish Camps Bay residence for 'safe space' usage” by Karel Dampies I understand the anger of some people in the community calling for the arrest of the queer people who unlawfully stay in the house in Camps Bay. But do South Africa and our districts have enough safe houses for queer people? I don’t think so. It is sad to see that even people who want to be who they are and live where they want to face being raped and murdered. The Camps Bay unlawful occupation was just to say “take care of us and protect us”. Maybe we as a community should have more education programmes and talks about queer people. I'm a support community worker. * Karel Dampies, Wellington. ** The views expressed here are not necessarily those of Independent Media.
