Cape Town - The demand for laboratory Covid-19 testing continues to decline across both public and private sectors, according to the Department of Health. Last week, the province eased its Covid-19 testing criteria in the Cape Metro region, to allow anyone with Covid-19 symptoms to get tested. Testing criteria in rural areas were unaffected by the restrictions in the Cape Metro, which had prioritised testing of Covid-19 vulnerable groups as per the risk-adjusted testing strategy. The recent change in testing criteria has seen some increase in public sector test demand, said Communications Deputy Director, Mark van der Heever. The Western Cape recorded 112 009 confirmed cases of Covid-19 infections, with 105 096 recoveries as of 1pm on Sunday. The death toll currently stands at 4253. To date, around 565 847 Covid-19 tests have been conducted. On Friday, Premier Alan Winde said messages on social media claiming that Covid-19 infections had risen, more specifically at certain Cape hospitals, were untrue and dismissed them as fake news. He cautioned the public against circulating unverified social media posts. “The province records an average test positivity rate below 10%; Covid-19 hospital admissions now make up just 5% of total admissions.” Cape Argus Do you have something on your mind; or want to comment on the big stories of the day?
