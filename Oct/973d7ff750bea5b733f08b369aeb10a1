Cape Town - A new campaign “We don’t need our oceans” aims to showcase what the country would be like without them, and can hopefully have a stronger impact on people’s negligent behaviours towards the environment. The campaign will shed light on how a healthy ocean impacts every human life and it is hoped it will become a larger movement to increase marine protection across the country and globe. Wildtrust Campaign lead Lauren van Nijkerk, said: “People don’t act like they need the oceans. Covid-19 certainly made people question their relationship with nature, but I do not believe it made people care less about themselves and more about the planet.” The aim was to remove the pressure and send the message that people do not act like they need their oceans so the plan was to confirm some people’s thoughts. The contradiction, however, was the campaign’s name, which would grab more people’s attention. Wildtrust executive director Roelie Kloppers said: “When we think of carbon sinks, we tend to think of large forests and we all understand the importance of growing trees. “We seldom think of the ocean as a carbon sink, yet it absorbs much of the green house gases our modern lifestyles produce. This campaign highlights the message that healthy oceans are essential for keeping the earth’s temperature under control and ensuring a thriving planet.” She said it is hoped that the marine protection will be increased from the current 5% to 10%. It is becoming urgent, people cannot be told everything is okay because it is not. It is not too late for people to change their behaviours. Visit www.oceanimpact.co.za Cape Argus
