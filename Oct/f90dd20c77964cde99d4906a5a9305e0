Cape Town – Sex workers are calling for SA Human Rights commissioner Chris Nissen to investigate the death of Elma Robyn Montsumi, a 39-year-old sex worker who died in police custody at Mowbray police station in April. The Sex Workers Education and Advocacy Task Force (Sweat), Sisonke, the National Movement of Sex Workers and Triangle Project protested in front of SAHRC provincial offices yesterday demanding that he take further steps in investigating Montsumi’s death. Sweat spokesperson Megan Lessing said a report regarding the manner in which Montsumi was treated was submitted to the SAHRC by one of their monitors on May 13. Lessing said after the submission of the report, Nissen communicated with the monitor stating that a meeting with the police and the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) would be arranged in order to discuss the matter. “The meeting did not take place,” she said, adding Sweat submitted a complaint to the SAHRC on August 28 detailing the information received from witnesses to Montsumi’s arrest. She said, to date, no feedback had been received. Constance Mathe, co-ordinator at the Asijiki Coalition (advocates for the decriminalisation of sex work) and a friend of Montsumi, demanded action be taken and feedback provided to them by November 15. Failing that, Sweat would continue with protest action to raise awareness regarding the manner that the SAHRC has neglected its mandate in that regard. Nissen said: “I have engaged with Sweat and told them the Human Rights Commission does not investigate death in cells. It’s Ipid and we are monitoring them”. IPID Spokesperson Ndileka Cola said Ipid conducted a preliminary investigation into death. The process included post-mortem and other investigative aids which concluded that the death of Motsumi was as a result of suicide. “The directorate did not make any departmental or criminal recommendations as a result of its findings,” she said.
