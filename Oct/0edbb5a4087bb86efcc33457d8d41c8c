Cape Town - The City of Cape Town is expected to take a final decision regarding water restriction levels after the official end of the rainfall season, on October 31, Local Government MEC Anton Bredell has said. “This will be done in consultation with national government, the agriculture sector and smaller municipalities, which share water supply sources with Cape Town,” he said. Bredell, announcing the latest increase in the provincial dam levels, praised the efforts by the public over the past few years to reduce water consumption. “In the City of Cape Town water usage went from 1.2 billion litres per day to less than 500 million litres per day at the height of the crisis. "Currently the number is estimated to be around 650 million litres of water per day,” he said. Mayor Dan Plato said: “Even though we need to continue being mindful of climate uncertainty, residents can in the short-term begin to relax water saving efforts in good conscience due to the significant increase in dam levels.” Cape Argus Do you have something on your mind; or want to comment on the big stories of the day?
