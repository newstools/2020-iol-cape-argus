Cape Town - A girl aged 19 was among three suspects arrested for the murder of 11-year-old Duran Visagie, who was fatally wounded by a stray bullet on the corner of Carmen and Joseph Avenue in Scottsdene last Tuesday. He died in hospital. Police spokesperson FC van Wyk said: “We can confirm that two males, aged 17 and 18, were arrested in Scottsdene, Kraaifontein, on Friday at 5am in a tracing operation by the Anti-Gang Unit detectives.” “After thoroughly questioning the suspects, members received information regarding the whereabouts of the murder weapon. “They went to search the residence of one of the suspect’s girlfriends in Yvonne Street, Scottsdene, and found the firearm, a 9mm Norinco pistol with 26 rounds hidden underneath the wendy house. “The girlfriend was arrested for the possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition.” “The suspects were charged with murder and will appear in the Blue Downs Magistrate’s Court on Monday (today),” said Van Wyk. Yesterday afternoon residents from Scottsdene came out in their numbers to support Visagie’s family and friends. They converged at the spot where Duran was shot, to pay their last respects. Duran’s grandfather, Piet Visagie, said the family welcomed the news of the suspects’ arrests and hoped justice would soon take its course. The family, along with friends and neighbours, sat alongside Duran’s heavily pregnant mother who sat solemnly and watched the proceedings of the gathering in tribute to her son. Cape Argus
