Cape Town - As the rest of the world commemorated World Habitat Day, human rights and land activists from across the city called on the government to not insult frustrated residents by joining in the festivities. Human Settlements MEC Tertuis Simmers said his department was fully committed to continue servicing and creating integrated communities across the province. “This day reminds us that we need to become more radical in accelerating the delivery of housing opportunities to the most vulnerable in our society. They are the elderly, persons with a certified disability, those on the Housing Demand Database for 15 years and longer and our backyard dwellers.” However, frustrated land invaders and backyard dwellers instead felt his optimism was mocking and not justified even after Simmers shared some impressive figures. Backyard dweller Shireen Smith said: “To us this is just another opportunity for the government to brag to a dead crowd about their meagre accomplishments and skate over the failures. It is sad and frustrating to have our pain and struggles used as tools to market projects that are never completed or for political warfare. We want less talk and more action.” The Social Justice Coalition said the government should not be commemorating world habitat day as it was insensitive to commemorate a day that works to celebrate the building of homes and recognises the link between human rights and dignity.
