Cape Town - In an effort to source and distribute nutritious meals for less privileged communities across the city, an international courier company has partnered with popular Woodstock-based food distribution organisation Mother Soup on its journey to distribute more than one million meals by December. Enticed by the organisation’s proficient record when it comes to assisting the less fortunate, DHL said that Mother Soup was a given choice when time came to decide on a partner organisation that would help it fulfil its goal to feed one million people in need across the Cape. Mother Soup organisation was founded by Woodstock Brewery during some of the most harrowing months under lockdown, when thousands of South Africans were hit by food insecurity. The brewery, which has some of the largest kettles in Cape Town, converted its kettles from brewing beer to making soup. DHL Express, sub-Saharan Africa chief Hennie Heymans said: “Food security is a critical social issue. We are thrilled to be in a position to support some worthy charities during this time. We are so excited and proud to be embarking on this journey alongside a notable and selfless organisation that works for the people.” Mother Soup produces and provides up to 8000 litres of nutritious soup on a daily basis and has fed over 2.2 million people across the city. Woodstock Brewery owner Andre Viljoen said: “The Woodstock Brewery and Great Commission United partnered during lockdown to form Mother Soup, an initiative that focuses on supplying nutritious hot soup to communities across Cape Town, as part of a community-led initiative to help those hardest hit by the Covid-19 pandemic.” “Mother Soup has managed to get on-board skilled chefs, a dietitian and a food technologist in the project. With our large, efficient and safe brewing pots, as well as optimised ingredients and sourcing practices, we were able to make generous donations of cash or ingredients go a long way,” said Viljoen.
