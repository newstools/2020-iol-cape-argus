Cape Town - Health MEC Nomafrench Mbombo, with Western Cape on Wellness (WoW!) kick-started "First Mondays" in Cloetesville on Monday, where the promotion of wellness will take precedence on the first Monday of each month. The event was held at the Breughel Theatre Hall. Mbombo said, “According to the World Health Organization, the definition of health is not only about the physical presence of a disease but encompasses social health, spiritual health, emotional health and the whole package of health. Health is everybody’s business.” WoW! Members took part in the Jerusalema dance to further promote physical wellness. "Even if you do have a disease, with medication only, you’ll never manage it. You’ll need physical activities, and a managed diet,” Mbombo said. She said physical activities delayed the onset of early chronic conditions and complications in people already diagnosed with chronic conditions.
