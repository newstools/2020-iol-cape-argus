Women suffer in silence and are not able to share their painful journey,  however, South African celebrities have worked hard to change the narrative behind the traumatic ordeal. TV personality and DJ, Lerato Kganyago, singer Mshoza and actress Bridget Masinga, are among celebrities who have opened up about their journeys of losing a child.
