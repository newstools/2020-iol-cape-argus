Cape Town - Sustainable jobs could be the solution for the economic recovery of countries post the pandemic, according to a new World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) report. The International Labour Organization and WWF found that nature-based solutions will allow a sustainable economic job recovery in the current pandemic after reviewing international evidence and case studies. The report aims to encourage policymakers to explore the potential of nature-based solutions which can be integrated into Covid-19 job response. WWF SA’s Urban Futures Programme’s Louise Scholtz said: “We need recovery packages to be sustainable by improving human well-being without harming nature and setting the foundations for transforming sectors and systems, while being able to maximise the creation of decent jobs especially through nature-based solutions.” Extinction Rebellion spokesperson Jade Vester said: “We don’t think the government is putting enough resources or effort into transitioning from fossil fuels into renewable and sustainable energy resources.” She said transitioning into renewable and sustainable energy resources will create jobs. However, this infrastructure still needs to be built and people need to be trained. Educating citizens about what a green economy would be is also very important. The report talks about the need for cross-collaboration and water-related nature-based solutions due to the issue of water and job insecurity in the country. Nature-based solutions for economic recovery include management of invasive species, ecosystem or watershed rehabilitation and restoration, reforestation and the use of agro-ecological approaches in food production.
