Cape Town - Police are investigating the cause of two fires in Wallacedene, Kraaifontein, over the weekend. On Friday evening, a fire swept through a row of over 33 shacks, completely destroying the homes of several families and claiming the life of a 15-year-old girl. Police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana said an inquest docket into the death of the girl had been opened. Rwexana said: “Police responded to a call for assistance at the Mhonqo squatter camp in Wallacedene on Friday morning at around 2am. Upon their arrival at the scene they found a row of shacks burned down and, upon further investigation, discovered the body of a 15-year-old girl.” On Saturday evening a number of families from Wallacedene were left homeless after a fire ravaged their homes in a temporary residential area and destroyed all their belongings Kraaifontein councillor Simpiwe Nonkeziyama said: “Last night (Saturday) a fire ravaged an informal settlement while many people were asleep. They all lost their belongings many of these families have school-going children. The two tragic incidents expose the lack of decent living conditions in the area The lack of urgency in changing the living situations of people in our community is disappointing and not justifiable. “The Constitutional Court handed down judgment (Grootboom case) more than a decade ago, for the City of Cape Town to build houses for Wallacedene residents, and instead of implementing the court judgment fully they decided to establish the temporary residential area (TRA). This TRA was built more than a decade ago. How do you call such a long time temporary?" The families affected by the fires had asked for help. “People can donate anything from food parcels, blankets and clothes. For the children, uniforms and books as well as stationery are needed.” Cape Argus
