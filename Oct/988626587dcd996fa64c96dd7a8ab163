Cape Town - A tree-planting ceremony was held on Tuesday for the late metro police officer Charlene Moses who died in June after contracting Covid-19. Moses started out as a taxi driver in 2003. She worked hard to reach her ranking in the metro police equestrian unit. She was respected by many after showing her dedication. Moses’s family, including her three children and husband, were present at the ceremony and all participated in planting a tree at the Green Point Precinct Tamarisk horse stables. Mayco member for safety and security, JP Smith, said: “Charlene is one of four metro staff who lost their lives as a result of Covid-19. We take the time to commemorate her, she made the sacrifice to go out every day at a time when many people were staying at home.” Last year she had just moved into a new home and been promoted to the equestrian unit. She worked across the service for many years and captured the hearts of many. Smith said: “She took no nonsense but was an absolute delight and is deeply missed in the metro police. A memorial service will also be held soon for all the metro staff with and without Covid-19 who have been lost in service.” Metro police chief Wayne le Roux said: “She represented a real leader and always encouraged people. I saw her as a future director, she had the potential to be a chief one day.” Cape Argus
