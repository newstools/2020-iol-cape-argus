Letter to Julius Dear Julius, please change your tactics! Can you imagine how miraculous it could be if you did a turnaround and became a leader such as our unique and precious Madiba was. Through him we are who we are today – a reborn South Africa with so much potential. Can you imagine how inspiring it would be for our youth, who you hold in your hands, to hear you urge them, as Madiba did, to be the best they can be. Urge them to study and follow his famous quote, “Education is the passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to those who prepare for it today”. Help our children to prepare for a fulfilling future and guide them with Madiba’s values of respect and love. Please stop the hate and incitement . Can you imagine how proud we could be to show the world we have grown another leader as unique and inspiring as Madiba was. You have the power, the opportunity and the potential. Please  don’t waste it. Gogo Cynthia. * Cynthia Marsden, Camps Bay. ** The views expressed here are not necessarily those of Independent Media.
