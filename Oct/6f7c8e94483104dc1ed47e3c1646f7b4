Cape Town - Eugene Toffa, a former switchboard manager at Independent Media, has died. Toffa, 65, worked at Independent Media from 1981 until his retirement in 2019. His cause of death was pulmonary edema, said his family, a condition caused by excess fluid in the lungs. Daughter Alicia Fester, 31, said her father died at around 7pm on Tuesday in hospital. “On Friday, his blood pressure was very low. There wasn’t a lot going on. “He was healthy and fit and the next minute the doctors said his sugar levels were high and that he needed to be admitted because he could fall into a coma.” Toffa, who lived on Bramble Way in Bonteheuwel, was admitted to Somerset Hospital on Friday and discharged the following day. He returned to hospital on Monday morning. Toffa was born in District Six before relocating with his family to Bonteheuwel as a child. He will be buried on Saturday. Toffa is survived by his widow Grace, daughters Alicia, Gladys Daniels and OIivia Williams, and two grandchildren.
