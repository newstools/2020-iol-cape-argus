I love curries. Why? Because they are easy to cook, hard to mess up and, with the right ingredients, taste unbelievable. Curries can vary greatly, depending on where they originate from. They can be further defined by cultural, traditional and personal preference by changing ingredients, spices and cooking methods. But the one feature that is universal is the complex combination of herbs, spices and fresh or dried chilli. Curries are versatile because you have the option to use the  vegetables and other ingredients you have on hand.
