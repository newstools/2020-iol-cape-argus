Cape Town - Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) deputy president Floyd Shivambu's attempts to have his assault case settled out of court have failed. Shivambu appeared in the Cape Town Magistrates Court on Thursday morning for allegedly assaulting a Netwerk24  journalist and photographer Adrian de Kock outside Parliament precinct in March 2018. Shivambu's lawyer, Ross McKernan, told the court representations for diversion and mediation has been denied by the National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP). National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) spokesperson Eric Ntabazalila said Shivambu's case has been postponed to February 11, next year for trial. "Shivambu is charged with common assault following an assault of a journalist in the parliamentary precinct in March 2018," Ntabazalila said. De Kock was allegedly choked and hit in the face when he approached Shivambu for comment on former Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lilleâ€™s disciplinary hearing, which was being held in Parliament at the time. De Kock said he approached Shivambu for comment on the De Lille issue but was almost immediately pushed away. Shivambu also pushed De Kock in full view of journalists and parliamentary staff. A scuffle broke out between De Kock and Shivambu who later walked away when he saw journalists approaching.
