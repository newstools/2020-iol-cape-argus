Pap is a traditional South African staple. It is enjoyed by many people of different cultures across the country. If pap is prepared correctly, it tastes great and leaves you feeling satisfied and full. However, people have different ideas on how to prepare pap. Last week, Nontobeko Mbatha who is an anatomical pathologist and lecturer at the University of Witwatersrand’s Medical School, took to Twitter to share a 20-second video that shows how to cook pap using a non-stick pot. “Ladies liberate yourself and cook pap in a non-stick pot. No pot washing admin afterwards. I just discovered this myself,” she wrote. Twitter users disagreed with her, saying a good pap needs to form a crust at the bottom of the pot. @NMkhabela wrote: “That is not how you cook papa.
