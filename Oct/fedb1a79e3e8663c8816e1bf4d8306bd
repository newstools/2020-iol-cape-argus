by Colin Bosman It was like waking up on Christmas morning when reading in the media that the Hawks had finally swooped down on some of the thieves and scoundrels who had stolen billions from the Treasury, not only during the Covid-19 pandemic but for many years before. However, it is disingenuous and shortsighted to whoop whoop too soon as an arrest and a conviction are two different animals. Considering the billions of rand stolen and misappropriated, those implicated are so well funded from their ill-gotten gains they will be able to fight the authorities in court until the end of time. One need only look at the long-standing trial of Jacob Zuma who was charged with 16 counts of corruption, racketeering and money laundering which has its roots in the infamous arms deal which goes back to the 1990s. Zuma’s legal game of playing with appeals, postponements, and now his latest attack on Judge Raymond Zondo by demanding his recusal are legendary. Clearly those arrested won’t be too stressed at this stage as they will all be out on bail within 48 hours and dancing to the same tune as JZ in the months and years ahead. Game set and match in the legal process is still a long way off and one can only hope justice will prevail and orange overalls will replace black dinner jackets for those characters who have looted the country and lined their pockets at the expense of the people of South Africa. * Colin Bosman, Newlands. ** The views expressed here are not necessarily those of Independent Media.
