Cape Town – Police are continuing their search for two missing 7-year-old boys from Khayelitsha as their anxious parents wait for any news. Police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana said the search for the two boys, Miyolo Gwinta and Lunathi Ntshongo, was on-going. “Detectives attached to the Khayelitsha FCS (Family Violence and Child Protection Unit) and police are searching and following leads,” she said. The boys were last seen in a delivery truck that went to Bosasa in Mfuleni. Miyolo’s mother, Thembakazi Gwinta, said, however, the police only came with two sniffer dogs yesterday, four days after the boys had disappeared. She said the police were not giving appropriate attention to the case. “One of the boys that saw them riding delivery trucks told the police everything and we expected them to have strong leads by now, but our kids are still missing,” she said. Lunathi’s father Lungisani Ntshonga said what was also embarrassing was the fact the detective who was assigned to the case had never visited them, or knew where they stayed. “They only started searching yesterday for kids that got missing on Thursday,” he said.
