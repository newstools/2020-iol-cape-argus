Since the start of Khanyi Mbau’s new reality show on BET Africa, we have been living for her extravagant lifestyle. This week, the actress gave viewers a peak inside her new home, and we were impressed. In the second episode of “Mbau Reloaded: Always Rise”, Mbau mentions that she wanted to downgrade her home from the previous one, leaving many tweeps confused. The all-white aesthetic is something most of us can only dream about, but for the queen of reinvention, it’s apparently a step down. Taking to Twitter after the episode aired, the “Red Room” star responded to a tweep who questioned her move with “Bro I downgraded my previous place was massive.” Bro I downgraded my previous place was massive https://t.co/ksr5hd2jx1 For those who follow the actress on Instagram, Mbau regularly showcases parts of her home in her posts. ‘Tis absolutely the season A post shared by  Khanyi Mbau Metanoia (@mbaureloaded) on Oct 17, 2020 at 5:09am PDT To say it’s a downgrade, well … I literally have no more clothes!
