Cape Town - Mayco member for safety and security JP Smith has condemned an attack on two firefighters, who were robbed at gunpoint in Wallacedene, Kraaifontein, early on Saturday morning. According to the City’s fire and rescue service spokesperson Jermaine Carelse, the firefighters were robbed and assaulted by three gunmen in Wallacedene after responding to a call that shacks were on fire. Carelse said: “Two City firefighters had to receive treatment at hospital after being assaulted in Wallacedene in the early hours of (Saturday) morning. "The crew from Brackenfell responded to a call about a fire, and on arrival, the two of them made their way between the structures to investigate the source of smoke they were seeing. "They were accosted by three men who threatened them at gunpoint and robbed them of their belongings, before assaulting them. “An investigation into the incident found that there had been no structural fire, as reported, which made it appear as if the call had been a trap.” Smith called for a probe into the attack. “Attacks on the City’s front-line staff are becoming all too common in local communities, especially (attacks on) our firefighters. “These officers provide a lifesaving service and every incident of this nature chips away at the trust between the fire service and the communities they serve. The City appeals to anyone with information about this attack to report it to the City’s public emergency communications centre by dialling 021 480 7700 from a cellphone or 107 from a landline."
