Cape Town - Businessman and Struggle activist Anwah Nagia, who passed away almost two weeks ago, was fondly remembered at an intimate service at the Castle of Good Hope on Monday. Human Sciences Research Council chief executive Professor Crain Soudien said: “Anwah was a stalwart of the Struggle and there are only a few among us that can truly tell the story of the 1980s. His story is the story of Cape Town that everyone needs to hear about and absorb.” He said the activists were the ones who drove the movements which shaped Cape Town, and Nagia was at the heart of this. “Our biggest campaign was the District Six campaign. The most prominent, consistent and principled of the house members was Anwah. I can’t explain enough how principled he was with leading these initiatives. He also became wealthy and didn’t use it for material gain. Instead, he gave it all away,” he said. Muslim Judicial Council deputy president of the Abdul Khaliq Ebrahim Allie said: “During Anwah’s life, he has touched lives from young to old. He stood for justice and for what is right. He also lived a full life, which was one that touched every sector of society.” Allie said the legacy of his life must live on, and what is seen today is the responsibility of everyone. Western Cape High Court Judge Siraj Desai said: “Anwah was at the forefront of the Struggle for several decades to preserve District Six land for restitution. He resisted the encroachment on District Six land by private developers. The land, for him, was ‘salted earth’.” He said Anwah’s passion and energy will be difficult to match, but the aim is to resolve and continue his causes. Long time friend of Anwah and Bo Kaap Civic and Ratepayers Association chairperson Osman Shaboodien said: “Anwah divided himself into a thousand pieces on a daily basis for people. He also could easily have filled the seats of corrupt officials or become a billionaire, but all he wanted was to be a human being.” Cape Argus
