World-famous singer and businesswoman, Rihanna, has issued an apology for the Hadith incident that happened at her fashion show. At the Savage X Fenty volume 2 fashion show held in New York on October 2, Rihanna found herself in hot water for selecting a song that uses the narration of a Hadith about the signs of the day of judgement. A Ḥadīth in Islam refers to what Muslims believe to be a record of the words, actions, and the silent approval of the prophet Muhammad (saw). It is regarded as sacred and second only to the Qur’an. As such, Rihanna’s act was deemed inappropriate and disrespectful. A post shared by SAVAGE X FENTY BY RIHANNA (@savagexfenty) on Oct 6, 2020 at 11:27am PDT The singer took to Instagram to issue an apology. She said: “I’d like to thank the Muslim community for pointing out a huge oversight that was unintentionally offensive in our Savage X Fenty show. I would, more importantly, like to apologise to you for this honest, yet careless mistake. We understand that we have hurt many of our Muslim brothers and sisters,  and I’m incredibly disheartened by this!” She added: “I do not play with any kind of disrespect towards God or any religion and, therefore,  the use of the song in our project was completely irresponsible! Moving forward, we will make sure nothing like this ever happens again. Thank you for your forgiveness and understanding, Rih.” At the event, Rihanna introduced a new men’s underwear range featuring Big Sean, Christian Combs and Miguel.
