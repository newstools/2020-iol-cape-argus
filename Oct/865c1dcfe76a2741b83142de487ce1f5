Cape Town - A 29-year-old community and youth activist from Khayelitsha is looking forward to cycling from the township to Soweto in an effort to raise money to support and run a community youth hub he recently opened in his own home. Residents are celebrating the launch of Ikhaya Elitsha Hub, created by Mboneleli Gqirana. Gqirana, well known in the community for his advocacy for youth-oriented initiatives, is also the convener of the Site C Youth Forum and the Site C Community Action Network. “For the past six years the dream was always to create a safe, youth hub for the young people in my community. I wanted to give young people a place to call their own. Here they can work uninterrupted, learn among themselves, and create and collaborate to better their lives and, in turn, drive this community forward positively.” Ikhaya Elitsha Hub was officially launched this month, and although it has been well received there is a struggle to renovate and buy essential items. “To see that vision come to life piece by piece has been amazing, however there is still a lot of work to be done. We are in need of funding and various pieces of furniture and material products to make the hub what it’s meant to be. We have a backabuddy campaign currently running to raise money for the different projects we plan to host at the hub, and currently we are planning to cycle from Khayelitsha to Soweto, also to raise funds and encourage people to support the youth hub,” said Gqirana. Entrepreneur Nomzamo Kilana said when she first heard about the idea to create a youth hub she was excited. “I couldn’t be more grateful to have it in my neighbourhood, and although it’s still undergoing renovations, it’s a space and offers so many initiatives that we can use to grow and prosper as young people,” said Kilana.
