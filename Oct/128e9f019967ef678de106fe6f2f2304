Cape Town - Community leaders from Kraaifontein are calling on the City not to scrap the Maroela housing project, which will benefit hundreds of residents, by shifting the millions in funds budgeted for it to another ward. The Kraaifontein Community Advisory Services (CAS) team had a meeting with Mayco member for Human Settlements Malusi Booi last week, where he said that the funds set aside for the Maroela housing project would be re-allocated. Linda Phito from CAS said that Booi, on two different occasions, had been approached by the advisory committee and community leaders to try to find an alternative area for land invaders and move them from the space they were occupying, which was also the area allocated for the Maroela housing project. “We suggested that the invaders be moved to temporary vacant land until a solution is found, while the Maroela project proceeds as planned. “As much as we would like to see the housing initiative succeed, our goal is to also cater for all Kraaifontein residents as best as we can,” said Phito. “For him to say that they might allocate the budget for the Maroela project to another ward is unfair and unconstitutional. “Should such a drastic measure be taken, we will contest it because the community of Bloekombos in Kraaifontein has been waiting for this budget for years.” In response to the allegations, Booi said that the City was backed by court orders and would continue to do everything in its power to protect the project and the rightful beneficiaries. “This project is worth R110 million and the City will continue to stand up for its beneficiaries, communities and law-abiding residents. Illegal occupation of land cannot be the answer. “We urge political parties, activist organisations and community leaders to please consider the bigger picture and to stop driving or condoning land invasions for short-term gain, as the long-term impacts are immense,” said Booi.
