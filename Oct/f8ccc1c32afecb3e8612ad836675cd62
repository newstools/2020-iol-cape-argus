Anyone who follows Michael Bucwa AKA Mr Smeg on Twitter knows that when it comes to his much-loved kitchen appliances, all bets are off.

The coveted brand has become synonymous with all things luxurious in SA. If you own a Smeg appliance, well, then youâ€™ve made it in life. Itâ€™s no wonder Bucwa has gained such a huge following. But he was heartbroken when he revealed to his more than 120K followers that his beloved kettle had gone missing. The pricey Smeg kettle is often pictured with him, in his car, for example, on his balcony or chatting to the neighbours. Even his thirst trap pics include the shiny, red appliance. smeg pic.twitter.com/LSaxY3Y6vF When asked by a fellow user whatâ€™s been bothering him, he admitted that his prized possession had been stolen.
