Kruger Shalati Train on a Bridge is moving full steam ahead (pun intended). The luxury hotel will open in December 2020 and located  in the heart of the Kruger National Park, in the ever-popular Skukuza area. The hotel is being developed by Kruger Shalati Concession, who will see a luxury hotel housed inside a restored and reimagined train stationed on the bridge crossing the Sabie River called the Selati Bridge. This exciting new hotel includes train-based-rooms, lounge and dining areas and a pool dangling from the bridge that overlooks the Sabie River. It's described by the Robb Report as an ‘Insane New Boutique Hotel’. Meanwhile, the newly opened, The Kruger Station, which is part of the Kruger Shalati project, has created a bespoke designed and crafted space for travellers and foodies.
