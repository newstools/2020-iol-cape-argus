In a one-line communication signed by IHS Markit’s head of corporate PR, Sebastian Kadritzke, the organisers said: “It is not for us to comment on a potential press conference by other organisations.” On Thursday, Extinction Rebellion will target the meeting to discuss the future of coal mining. Claiming the conference had been scheduled for Mpumalanga, Extinction Rebellion spokesperson Jade Vester said: “To avoid community protests, the organisers have deliberately moved the venue to Cape Town, 1700km away from the affected communities, and too far for protesters to travel. “Coal is the dirtiest and most destructive energy source in the world, contributing 40% to the world’s carbon-dioxide emissions. This makes coal a major factor in our global climate emergency, which scientists say is an existential threat to humanity as a whole and may lead to the deaths of millions of people over the next decades, if emissions are not cut dramatically.” Vester said that on Thursday, at the Westin in Cape Town, Minister of Mineral Resources and Energy, Gwede Mantashe, would give a keynote address side-by-side with coal tycoon Mike Teke of Seriti resources, South Africa’s second-largest coal producer. “The team is not expected to announce any radical changes. Both have indicated on numerous occasions that coal in South Africa is meant to stay. They seem deaf and blind towards international developments and warnings,” she said. mwangi.githau@inl.co.za Cape Argus
