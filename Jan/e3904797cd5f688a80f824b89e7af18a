  Over the past few months, Oosthuizen’s column dealt with him coming to terms with his terminal diagnosis, the dietary advice he received from well-wishers, and the loss of friendships. Oosthuizen had been in and out of Groote Schuur Hospital but on New Year’s Eve he would be admitted for the last time, spending his final days in Ward F16. A heartbroken Witten said: “I’m glad his suffering is over and I’m proud of what he’d managed to achieve, changing mindsets about the homeless and bringing the concerns and challenges of the least in society to the attention of the rest of us.”   Abarder, describing Oosthuizen as a beautiful soul, said: “The greatest tribute we can pay him is to continue the incredible work he has done in highlighting the plight of the homeless people.” A close friend of Oosthuizen, Mark Williams, said: “Danny and my sister were diagnosed around the same time and a few months ago she died. This brings a lot of emotions for me. “I frequently visited Danny when he was in hospital and he always had a smile on his face, which would make my day.” Weekend Argus editor Jade Otto, who worked with Oosthuizen when she was news editor of the Cape Argus in 2015, described him as a ray of sunshine in the newsroom: “Initially, he asked advice and guidance when putting together his column but later became more confident and would often challenge the authorities in his quest for the rights of the homeless.”             It was Oosthuizen’s fearlessness and harsh criticism of the City’s treatment of the homeless that prompted it to start a Safe Space for the homeless under the Culemborg Bridge. Mayco member for safety and security JP Smith said: “Danny was always fair in his criticism towards the City. One can appreciate the fact that he had a moral compass, he responded without any fear or favour or hidden agendas. I had a lot of respect for him. We constantly spoke and he was part of the idea to create the Safe Space.” Mayor Dan Plato said: I read his columns regularly and while he sometimes pointed out the shortcomings in the city, he would also compliment the City for its services. His honest and objective voice will be missed.” Danny's memorial will be held at St Georges Cathedral on the 9th January at 10am.   marvin.charles@inl.co.za Cape Argus
