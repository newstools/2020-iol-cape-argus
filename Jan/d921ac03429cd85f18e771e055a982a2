Patrick Kotze, speaking after Chawdwin Isaacs and Valentino Hoffmeester, arrested in connection with the murder of his son Valentino, abandoned their bail application in the Wynberg Magistrate’s Court, said it was tough for the younger boy. “He cries a lot and because he is only starting to talk now, it’s very difficult for him to say what is wrong. But whenever there is a loud noise in the house, or shots fired in the flats, then he cries uncontrollably,” he said. The two suspects face charges of murder, attempted murder and possession of an unlicensed firearm relating to the shooting that claimed the life of Valentino and wounded an alleged Mongrels gangster who was also at the scene. The incident happened in December last year at Drury Court in Lavender Hill. The pair were not asked to plead on Thursday and their legal representative informed the court they had abandoned their bail application. Prosecutor Nicky Koniso said the forensic, ballistics and post-mortem reports, as well as witness statements, were still outstanding. The Anti-Gang Unit is investigating the murder and, according to the investigating officer, more arrests are imminent. After the court proceeding yesterday, the dead boy’s mother, Romana Grootetjie, said: “Valentino was supposed to start his Grade R this year, and look where he is starting it: in a grave. Everything is still too raw. I wish the keys to their cells are thrown away.” The two suspects are back in court on March 12. vincent.cruywagen@inl.co.za Cape Argus
