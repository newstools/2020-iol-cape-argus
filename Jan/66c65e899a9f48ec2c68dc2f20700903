Johannesburg - Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga is set to use this week to meet stakeholders to discuss progress on work done regarding the Basic Education Laws Amendment (Bela) Bill. On Tuesday, Motshekga met with the country’s school governing body (SGB) associations following the Department of Basic Education’s completion of public consultations. The bill in question seeks, among other things, to provide updated amendments to sections of the South African Schools Act. The meeting discussed admissions regulations, appointment of teachers, random search and seizure of pupils, as well as the terms and criteria for SGB members. “We are committed to supporting the department in ensuring that schools run smoothly. The department should address matters where governing bodies make mistakes,” said ­Federation of Governing Bodies of South African Schools chief executive Paul Colditz. On home education, the minister stressed the importance of meeting all legal obligations. “There must be initial registration for pupils who are educated at home, in order for us to know how many pupils in the system fall within home education” said Motshekga. She will meet with other stakeholders and teacher unions before tabling the bill in Parliament. Political Bureau
