Cape Town – A suspect is expected to appear in the Blue Downs Magistrate's Court on Tuesday after the Hawks intercepted a truck which was on its way to Cape Town with a container loaded with cocaine worth over R30.4 million. The truck was intercepted at a petrol station on the N1 in the early hours on Sunday. "A search of the container ensued in earnest and members managed to seize a total of 38 cocaine wrapped packages weighing 1kg each.  A 37-year-old suspect was arrested and a vehicle used to collect the drugs was also seized," the Hawks said on Monday. "Preliminary investigations have established that the container came from abroad and transited through different provinces before making its way to Cape Town." The national head of the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation, Lieutenant-General Godfrey Lebeya, has applauded the team for the arrest and drug seizure. “This haul and many others that have been recently confiscated shows that the supply chains of organised criminal groups have been severed. "May I also call upon the community not to support organised criminal groups by purchasing drugs as this demand will encourage the syndicates to find new ways of providing these dangerous substances,” said Lebeya.
