The dramatic weather Cape Town experienced last weekend, combined with significantly reduced consumption for the week, saw the City’s dam levels increase by just under 4%, according to a statement from the City earlier this week. Sputnik Ratau, the national spokesperson for DWS, said: “While the heavy downpours have led to undesired misery for some communities, they have provided much-needed water to boost the Western Cape dam levels.” Meanwhile the provincial Department of Local Government, Environmental Affairs and Development Planning said: “The average dam level in the Western Cape increased to 44.4% from the previous year’s level of 39.3% at the same time, and this was before the weekend’s rainfall.” mwangi.githahu@inl.co.za Cape Argus Do you have something on your mind; or want to comment on the big stories of the day?
