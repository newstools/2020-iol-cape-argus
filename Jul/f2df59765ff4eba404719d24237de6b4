While scientist all over the world are working on developing a vaccine for the Covid 19 virus, South Africans seem to think that they've in fact found the "cure". On a cold winter's night nothing warms you up from the inside quite like a glass of sherry, but now rumour has it that not only does it warm you up, it even kills the deadly virus. The rumours of this miracle cure started when a voice note started circulating via Whatsapp after a woman in the Eastern Cape claimed that a  child had been "cured" after drinking Old Brown Sherry, a popular South African sherry produced by Sedgwick's. In the voice note, you hear a woman speaking Xhosa, saying that a child who had been very ill on death's bed was brought some sherry in a small juice bottle in hospital by an uncle. The child drank the sherry and by the next day he was fine. The woman adds that the sherry made the blood warm. The story spread like wildfire and soon found it's way on other social media platforms. For obvious reasons this caused quite a stir and folk had lots to say. Here what people had to say on Twitter.     Just had to buy my grandma old brown sherry. What is covid doing to our parents?!     @DrZweliMkhize & @CyrilRamaphosa I would like to alert you my leaders of a new myth specifically in the Eastern Cape!.
