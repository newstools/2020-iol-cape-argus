The reinstated ban on alcohol sales and curfew announced by the president are welcomed. I write about personal experience of the pure audacity and sheer arrogance of my closest friends who chose to celebrate birthdays, host parties, have unnecessary public prayer meetings of varied religions - which could have been held privately at home - and have meet-and-greet sessions at different friends’ homes or in hangout areas. The president could have done nothing better. The recent announcement was the best decision, holding more weight than the announcement of the level 5 lockdown. People at parties wear no masks. Physical distancing is a distant sober thought, non-existent in their intoxicated states, notwithstanding that even before the hundreds of litres of alcohol flow, even stone-cold sober, there is no sanitising or distancing. We know that people are asked to “stay home”, but the reality is that we live in township neighbourhoods and this is impossible. I could not believe people had the inflated sense of false self-confidence to celebrate their birthdays while their friends were fighting for their lives in hospital and their neighbour’s Covid-19 infected body was wrapped in plastic, placed in a coffin, nailed shut, without the usual dignified funerals we are used to. The ban and curfews renders such disgusting behaviour to the past. * Thando Dlomo, KwaMashu. ** The views expressed here are not necessarily those of Independent Media.
