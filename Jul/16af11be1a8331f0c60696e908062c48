She again reached number one with her collaboration with Tekashi 6ix9ine on "Trollz" although the song has since tumbled down the chart unlike "Say So" which has been a stable hit. Minaj previously mentioned that she would like to have kids before her fifth album and has alluded to it on multiple songs - it seems that her wish came true.
