The province reported 68 273 confirmed cases of the virus, with 49 928 recoveries made. As of 1pm on Sunday, the province had 16 293 active cases of Covid-19, according to the provincial update on the virus provided by Premier Alan Winde. To date, 2 052 have succumbed to the virus. The number of tests conducted are 323 763. Around 1 840 have been hospitalised due to the virus, with 317 patients in ICU or high care. There are 9 243 confirmed cases of Covid-19 unallocated, with 4 226 recoveries made. Winde said 73% of people who had contracted Covid-19 in the province had recovered. “So far, almost 50 000 people in the Western Cape have been able to beat Covid-19 and recover,” he said. Those who were over 55, and those with underlying health conditions such as diabetes and hypertension, were more likely to become seriously ill, require hospitalisation or die, he said. “Our data shows that almost half of all Covid-19 positive people in the province with diabetes have required hospitalisation, and of those hospitalised, 45% have died.” Therefore care for Covid-19 patients with diabetes would be prioritised to protect this vulnerable group, he said. “The province has implemented high-flow nasal oxygen treatment, which allows us to deliver lifesaving care without the need for an ICU bed or a ventilator,” said Winde. “A total of 121 machines are available to deliver this treatment, with 43 more on order. We have introduced the protocols for the use of steroids, which international research has shown to have positive impacts on the mortality rates of patients who require oxygen or ventilation.” Winde said the province had not yet reached its peak of infections and urged the public to follow safety measures, and to call the Western Cape hotline on 021 928 4102. shakirah.thebus@inl.co.za Cape Argus
