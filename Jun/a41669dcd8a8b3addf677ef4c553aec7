The Centre for Child Law (CCL) and the Children’s Institute (CI) are in support of this bill. It will provide a legal solution to ensure relatives caring for orphaned children can apply directly to Sassa for the child’s grant. Children’s Institute spokesperson Paula Proudlock said: “The department seemed to believe that if it added more social workers and made a few changes to how it managed foster-care cases, it could reach all orphans in need with a foster care grant. However, over the years, evidence showed that this approach was not working.” The organisations are calling for more support for the proposal of a Child Support Grant (CSG) “top-up” for relatives caring for orphaned children, instead of foster-child grants. This is also because of the increase in the number of children in the foster-care system. “The caregiver does not first need a social worker report and a court order, as is the case with a foster child grant. Applying for a CSG at Sassa is quick and easy, with an average waiting time of one month,” said Proudlock. “Applying to a social worker to assist you with a foster-care application to the Children’s Court will take one year if you are lucky.” sukaina.ishmail@inl.co.za Cape Argus  Do you have something on your mind; or want to comment on the big stories of the day?
