The last of the British travellers stranded in South Africa flew home on Thursday. Nigel Casey, the British High Commissioner to South Africa, said this was the last repatriation flight of British citizens from South Africa. He said over 5 000 people had been repatriated over the last three months, most from Cape Town and Joburg. He said: “These people have been coming from all over South Africa, including lots of people who have been in the Eastern Cape, in East London, Port Elizabeth and elsewhere. “Our objection has been to get all these people who were stranded here at the beginning of this crisis in March who was visiting from the UK back home. “I am really proud of this operation, but it is time to call a halt on it. We are stopping the operation globally from June 18. South Africa has been the last part of it. I am very pleased with the corporation we’ve had from Dirco, from the Department of Transport, from the Western Cape authorities and the police,” he said.  He said they will continue to support the 300 000 British Nationals who work and stay in South Africa. The British nationals are seen wearing masks and screen guards. Airport officials conducted screenings before they were able to check-in. In March, the UK government announced a £75 million initiative to fly Britons who were stranded abroad home. Foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said at the time that charter flights would help repatriate Britons from “priority countries”. The government has partnered with British Airways, Easyjet, Jet2 and other airlines to provide planes to bring Britons home from all corners of the world. .
