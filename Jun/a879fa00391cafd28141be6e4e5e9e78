In remembrance of that dark day, June 16 is now a public holiday, called Youth Day On June 16, 1991 Siyamthanda 'Siya' Kolisi was born in Zwide, a township just outside Port Elizabeth in the Eastern Cape. He made his Springbok debut as a substitute against Scotland in 2013, before becoming the first black captain of the Springboks in 2018. Kolisi went on to lead to the Boks to the 2019 Rugby World Cup in Japan, after they defeated England 32-12 in the final. Youth Day and Co-founder Siya Kolisi’s Birthday“My dream is to provide more opportunities for our youth to realise that whether they live in the suburbs or a township, they can be anyone they want to be.“ - @SiyaKolisi_Bear pic.twitter.com/NsYpWGKE0I  I asked him what he wanted to do for his birthday this year. He said: “all I want is to make sure people have food.” Happy Birthday my guy. We love you. A post shared by  Rachel Kolisi (@rachel_kolisi) on Jun 16, 2020 at 1:09am PDT
