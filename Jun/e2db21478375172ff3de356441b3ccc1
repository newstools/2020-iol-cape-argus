Faith Muthambi, chairperson of the portfolio committee on co-operative governance and traditional affairs, also asked the provincial Department of Local Government, Environmental Affairs and Development Planning to share its findings on the 2018 Diagnostic Assessment Report on the municipality. She said: “There must be effective monitoring and evaluation mechanism in place to address the municipality’s problems of maladministration and poor performance.” Muthambi received a briefing on Wednesday from Knysna United leader Ralph Stander, who said: “There is an installation of approximately 4000 pre-paid water meters project... which was not budgeted for. Furthermore, there was no official tender for the project and that was what prompted Knysna United to call for a forensic investigation into the allegations.” Knysna mayor Elrick van Aswegen, however, responded: “R32 million was spent on the installation and purchase of 7500 pre-paid meters, of which 6995 were received by the municipality; 5000 of those meters have been activated in nine out of the 11 municipal wards.” Van Aswegen said the municipality had experienced a political and administrative crisis since January 2018: “The position of the municipal manager was filled in an acting basis during that period and there was serious instability in the municipality.” The committee asked Knysna United to respond in writing on allegations of corruption levelled against it by the municipality. Muthambi said: “The committee has noted the commitment that was made by the department in the meeting to support the municipality in its turnaround financial recovery plan. “It told the municipality to come back and report in the next quarter (on) the steps it has taken on those who are responsible for the mess that the municipality finds itself in.” mwangi.githahu@inl.co.za Cape Argus
