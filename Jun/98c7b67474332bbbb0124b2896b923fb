Video footage of the incident shows a man running towards the flames spewing from a fuel tanker alight on the side of the road, with bystanders screaming at him to retreat from the blaze. Emergency Services manager in the Overberg district municipality Reinard Geldenhuys said: “On Saturday at about 12 noon, the Overberg Fire and Rescue control centre received a call of a vehicle accident on the Cape Town side of Houw Hoek Hotel. "We dispatched units from Grabouw and Caledon and upon arrival found a petrol tanker which was fortunately empty, well alight and a car down the embankment. One person was dead in the car and we also found a person burnt to death next to the truck that was still burning.” Geldenhuys said: “Upon investigation, and including witness accounts from people on the scene and a video that was given to us, it appeared that the person was in the car that was involved in a head-on collision with the truck. Then he got out of the car, and threw himself into the burning fuel under the truck, where he succumbed and obviously burnt to death."
