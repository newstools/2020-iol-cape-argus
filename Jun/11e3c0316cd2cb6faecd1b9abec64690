These should reach the standing committee no later than 4pm on June 26.” Copies of the Local Government Municipal Structures Amendment Bill will be available on request, along with an electronic version of the bill on the legislature’s website (www.wcpp.gov.za). When the committee was briefed on the proposed amendments by the Department of Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs, supported by the Electoral Commission of SA (IEC) on May 5, members were told the changes were informed by challenges that had been experienced by the IEC in the administration and management of local government elections. They were told that there were amendments that were related to the establishment of the executive committee, the councillors code of conduct, and the powers of the speaker and the member of the executive council. mwangi.githahu@inl.co.za Cape Argus
