If an individual tests positive for the virus, they pose a health risk to others, especially the elderly and those with co-morbidities, thus necessitating self-isolation or quarantine. According to the Health Department, self-isolation is required for a confirmed Covid-19 infection, or for confirmed direct contacts. Quarantine is for possible infections, i.e, those who have come into close contact with someone who tested positive for Covid-19 or is awaiting their test results. The period for self-isolation and quarantine is 14 days and symptoms must be monitored daily. Lettie Tsotsetsi was the first Covid-19 patient to have been discharged from the Pinelands isolation facility: “I was very happy really, after my difficult time. I am leaving this place happy; it was like a family, like a home.” Anneline van Wyk, who also made use of the facility and has since been discharged, added: “I came here to protect my mother. I was very happy here. I didn’t at all feel sick, you made us feel human through it all. I’m very glad I chose to come here.” The isolation and quarantine facilities offer a single room per person, as well as access to a bathroom with regular meals provided and a laundry service. The Red Dot Taxi service is used to transport anyone safely to and from facilities.
